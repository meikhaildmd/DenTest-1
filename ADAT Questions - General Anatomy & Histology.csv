All of the following pass between the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles EXCEPT:,Lingual nerve,Inferior alveolar nerve,Buccal nerve,Chorda tympani,3,"The infratemporal fossa contains important neurovascular structures that course between the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles. The lingual nerve and inferior alveolar nerve descend in this interval, and the chorda tympani joins the lingual nerve in this space to carry parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular ganglion and taste fibers to the anterior tongue. The buccal nerve, however, passes between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid, not between medial and lateral pterygoids. High-yield review: Between medial & lateral pterygoids → lingual nerve, inferior alveolar nerve, chorda tympani. Through heads of lateral pterygoid → buccal nerve. Clinical: inferior alveolar block is given in this region near the mandibular foramen.",7,,
"Which structure suspends the small intestine from the posterior abdominal wall and conveys its vessels, lymphatics, and nerves?",Greater omentum,Lesser omentum,Mesentery,Transverse mesocolon,3,"The mesentery is a double layer of peritoneum that suspends the jejunum and ileum from the posterior abdominal wall. It provides a conduit for branches of the superior mesenteric vessels, lymphatics, and autonomic nerves to reach the intestines. In contrast, the greater and lesser omenta attach to the stomach, and the transverse mesocolon suspends the transverse colon. High-yield review: Mesentery proper suspends jejunum + ileum. Omenta—greater = stomach to transverse colon, lesser = stomach to liver. Mesocolons anchor colon. Clinical: mesenteric ischemia results from compromise of SMA branches.",7,,
The first four right posterior intercostal veins drain into which vein?,Hemiazygos vein,Accessory hemiazygos vein,Right superior intercostal vein → azygos vein,Left brachiocephalic vein,3,"On the right side, the first posterior intercostal vein drains into the brachiocephalic vein. The 2nd–4th posterior intercostal veins unite to form the right superior intercostal vein, which then drains into the azygos vein. The remaining right posterior intercostal veins drain directly into the azygos vein. On the left side, drainage is via the accessory hemiazygos and hemiazygos veins into the azygos. High-yield review: Right 1st = brachiocephalic. Right 2nd–4th = right superior intercostal → azygos. Right 5th–11th = directly to azygos. Clinical: azygos system provides collateral between SVC and IVC.",7,,
Which connective tissue layer surrounds multiple fascicles of a peripheral nerve?,Endoneurium,Perineurium,Epineurium,Myelin sheath,3,"Peripheral nerves are organized into layers of connective tissue. The endoneurium surrounds individual axons (and their Schwann cell myelin sheaths). Multiple axons are bundled into fascicles, which are encased by the perineurium — a specialized barrier that also maintains the blood–nerve barrier. Finally, multiple fascicles are grouped together and surrounded by the epineurium, the outermost connective tissue sheath, which contains blood vessels and provides overall protection and tensile strength to the nerve. High-yield review: Endoneurium—around individual axons. Perineurium—around fascicles (blood–nerve barrier). Epineurium—around multiple fascicles (whole nerve). Clinical: Schwannomas arise from Schwann cells (endoneurium level); perineurium important in local anesthesia spread.",7,,
Which of the following is a function of Clara (club) cells in the bronchioles?,Secrete surfactant phospholipids for alveolar expansion,Secrete protective proteins and mucous-like material in bronchioles,Provide structural support for alveoli,Form tight junctions to prevent alveolar collapse,2,"Clara cells, also called club cells, are non-ciliated, dome-shaped epithelial cells located in the terminal bronchioles. They secrete protective proteins, glycosaminoglycans, and a mucous-like material that helps maintain bronchiolar lining integrity. They also detoxify harmful substances via cytochrome P450 enzymes, act as progenitor cells for bronchiolar epithelium, and contribute to local immune defense. Unlike type II pneumocytes, Clara cells do not produce alveolar surfactant, but their secretions help reduce surface tension in smaller airways. High-yield review: Location—bronchioles. Function—secrete protective proteins and mucous-like fluid, detoxify toxins, progenitor cells. Differentiate: Type II pneumocytes—surfactant; Goblet cells—mucus in larger bronchi/trachea. Clinical—loss of Clara cells linked to toxic lung injury and chronic inflammation.",7,,
A 45-year-old obese patient presents with shoulder pain. Which of the following nerves is most directly responsible for motor innervation of the deltoid and sensory innervation over the lateral shoulder?,Axillary nerve (C5–C6),Musculocutaneous nerve (C5–C7),Radial nerve (C5–T1),Ulnar nerve (C8–T1),1,"The axillary nerve arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (C5–C6). It innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles and provides cutaneous sensation over the lateral shoulder (the regimental badge area). Injury can occur with surgical neck fractures of the humerus or anterior shoulder dislocation. High-yield review: Axillary nerve—posterior cord, C5–C6. Motor: deltoid and teres minor. Sensory: lateral shoulder skin. Injury: surgical neck fracture, shoulder dislocation, compression.",7,,
"Which part of the brachial plexus gives rise to the terminal branches Musculocutaneous, Axillary, Radial, Median, and Ulnar nerves (MARMU)?",Roots,Trunks,Cords,Terminal branches,4,"The brachial plexus is organized as roots (C5–T1), trunks (upper, middle, lower), divisions (anterior and posterior), cords (lateral, medial, posterior), and terminal branches. The terminal branches are the most distal part of the plexus and include Musculocutaneous, Axillary, Radial, Median, and Ulnar nerves (MARMU). High-yield review: Roots → trunks → divisions → cords → terminal branches. Terminal branches innervate the major muscles and cutaneous regions of the upper limb.",7,,
Which of the following best describes enamel tufts?,"Hypocalcified, protein-rich structures projecting from the DEJ into enamel",Microscopic cracks that traverse the full thickness of enamel from surface toward the DEJ,Trapped odontoblastic processes that extend a short distance into enamel,Surface furrows seen cervically on erupted enamel,1,"Enamel tufts are hypomineralized, protein-rich brush-like structures that originate at the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) and project a short distance into enamel. They arise along prism boundaries where mineralization is incomplete and serve to dissipate stress, preventing enamel fracture. They are associated with gnarled enamel and Hunter–Schreger bands, both of which reflect decussation of enamel prisms. Option 2 describes enamel lamellae, which are cracks or faults that extend from the enamel surface toward the DEJ. Option 3 describes enamel spindles, which are trapped odontoblastic processes at the DEJ. Option 4 describes perikymata, surface furrows related to Lines of Retzius. High-yield review: Tufts = DEJ origin, protein-rich, hypomineralized, stress-dissipating structures.",7,,
Enamel spindles are formed by which of the following?,Trapped odontoblastic processes that extend across the DEJ into enamel,Protein-rich hypocalcified defects arising at the DEJ that project into enamel,Leaf-like cracks extending from enamel surface toward the DEJ,Incremental growth lines running obliquely through enamel,1,"Enamel spindles form when odontoblastic processes from dentin cross the DEJ and become trapped in enamel during development. They appear as short, linear structures near cusp tips and should not be confused with other enamel defects. Option 2 refers to enamel tufts, hypocalcified, protein-rich projections from the DEJ. Option 3 describes enamel lamellae, cracks that can extend through the enamel thickness. Option 4 refers to Lines of Retzius, incremental growth lines in enamel. High-yield review: Spindles = odontoblast processes trapped in enamel; Tufts = hypomineralized protein-rich DEJ projections; Lamellae = cracks from surface inward.",7,,
Enamel lamellae differ from tufts and spindles because they are best described as:,"Hypocalcified, protein-rich projections that arise from the DEJ",Trapped odontoblastic processes located just inside enamel,Leaf-like faults or cracks that extend from the enamel surface toward the DEJ,External cervical furrows representing incremental growth,3,"Enamel lamellae are thin, leaf-like cracks or faults that typically originate at the enamel surface and extend toward the DEJ. They may cross into dentin and can be developmental (areas of incomplete prism maturation) or acquired (post-eruptive microcracks). They are significant because they can serve as pathways for caries spread. Option 1 describes enamel tufts, protein-rich defects at the DEJ. Option 2 describes enamel spindles, odontoblast processes trapped at the DEJ. Option 4 describes perikymata, surface furrows related to enamel growth lines. High-yield review: Lamellae = surface-origin cracks through enamel, potential caries pathways; Tufts = DEJ defects; Spindles = trapped odontoblasts.",7,,
The right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery both originate from which vessel?,Arch of the aorta directly,Brachiocephalic trunk (artery),Right internal thoracic artery,Vertebral artery,2,"The brachiocephalic trunk (brachiocephalic artery) is the first major branch of the aortic arch. It ascends and divides into the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery, supplying the right arm and right side of the head and neck. In contrast, the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries arise directly from the aortic arch. Option 1 (arch of aorta directly) applies only to the left common carotid and subclavian. Option 3 (right internal thoracic artery) is a branch of the subclavian, not a source. Option 4 (vertebral artery) arises from the subclavian and supplies the posterior circulation of the brain. High-yield review: Arch of aorta branches (right to left) = Brachiocephalic trunk → Left common carotid → Left subclavian. Only the right side uses a brachiocephalic trunk.",7,,
Which cranial nerves are responsible for the gag reflex?,CN V (trigeminal) and CN VII (facial),CN IX (glossopharyngeal) and CN X (vagus),CN XI (accessory) and CN XII (hypoglossal),CN II (optic) and CN III (oculomotor),2,"The gag reflex requires sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) components. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) provides afferent sensation from the pharynx, while the vagus nerve (CN X) supplies efferent motor innervation to the pharyngeal muscles via the nucleus ambiguus. CN V, VII, XI, and XII are not involved. High-yield: CN IX (afferent), CN X (efferent), medullary reflex arc.",7,,
The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (V2) passes through all of the following except:,Foramen rotundum,Foramen lacerum,Pterygopalatine fossa,Inferior orbital fissure,2,"V2 exits the middle cranial fossa via the foramen rotundum, enters the pterygopalatine fossa, and continues anteriorly through the inferior orbital fissure to become the infraorbital nerve. The foramen lacerum does not transmit any cranial nerves. High-yield: V1 → superior orbital fissure; V2 → foramen rotundum; V3 → foramen ovale.",7,,
Which division of the trigeminal nerve passes through the superior orbital fissure?,V1 (ophthalmic nerve),V2 (maxillary nerve),V3 (mandibular nerve),Facial nerve,1,"The ophthalmic nerve (V1) passes through the superior orbital fissure along with CN III, IV, and VI.

The maxillary division (V2) of the trigeminal nerve exits the skull via:,Superior orbital fissure,Foramen ovale,Foramen rotundum,Foramen spinosum,3,"V2 leaves the middle cranial fossa via the foramen rotundum to enter the pterygopalatine fossa. V1 passes through the superior orbital fissure, V3 through the foramen ovale, and the middle meningeal artery through the foramen spinosum.",7,,
Which cranial nerve passes through the foramen ovale?,V1 (ophthalmic),V2 (maxillary),V3 (mandibular),Facial nerve,3,"The mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3) exits the skull via the foramen ovale. V1 passes through the superior orbital fissure, V2 through the foramen rotundum, and the facial nerve via the internal acoustic meatus.",7,,
Which structure passes through the foramen spinosum?,Middle meningeal artery,Internal carotid artery,Maxillary nerve (V2),Ophthalmic nerve (V1),1,"The foramen spinosum transmits the middle meningeal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery. This artery is clinically important in epidural hematomas when ruptured. High-yield: foramen spinosum → middle meningeal artery.",7,,
Hunter–Schreger bands in enamel are visible due to:,Enamel prisms arranged parallel to each other,Enamel prisms arranged in layers at right angles to each other,Enamel lamellae penetrating from surface to DEJ,Hypocalcified areas in the cervical enamel,2,"Hunter–Schreger bands are alternating light and dark patterns seen in enamel under reflected light. They result from groups of enamel prisms changing orientation in alternating directions, usually at right angles. This arrangement strengthens enamel by deflecting cracks and preventing straight-line propagation. They are most visible on cusp tips and incisal edges, where occlusal forces are greatest. Differentiation from other structures is important: tufts are hypocalcified enamel areas near the DEJ, lamellae are thin linear enamel defects, and spindles are trapped odontoblast processes.",7,,
"The dental papilla, which gives rise to dentin and pulp, originates from:",Oral ectoderm,Ectomesenchyme (neural crest–derived),Stellate reticulum,Dental follicle,2,"The dental papilla is a condensation of ectomesenchymal tissue derived from neural crest cells. Located beneath the enamel organ, it plays a central role in odontogenesis. Peripheral papilla cells differentiate into odontoblasts, which secrete predentin that mineralizes into dentin, while the central papilla remains as dental pulp containing nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. This explains why dentin and pulp are closely integrated as the dentin–pulp complex, with pulp inflammation often leading to dentinal pain.",7,,
Which layer of the enamel organ differentiates to form the cells that secrete enamel?,Stellate reticulum,Inner enamel epithelium,Outer enamel epithelium,Stratum intermedium,2,"The enamel organ is ectodermal in origin and has four layers: inner enamel epithelium (IEE), outer enamel epithelium (OEE), stellate reticulum, and stratum intermedium. The IEE differentiates into ameloblasts, which secrete enamel matrix. The OEE provides protection and maintains crown shape, the stellate reticulum cushions and preserves space for enamel development, and the stratum intermedium supports mineralization via alkaline phosphatase. Enamel is unique as the only ectoderm-derived hard tissue, 96% mineralized and incapable of repair once formed.",7,,
The dental papilla ultimately gives rise to which tissues?,Enamel,Dentin and pulp,Cementum,Periodontal ligament,2,"The dental papilla is a neural crest–derived ectomesenchymal condensation located beneath the enamel organ. Its peripheral cells differentiate into odontoblasts that secrete predentin, which mineralizes into dentin, while its central portion becomes the dental pulp. This relationship explains the concept of the dentin–pulp complex, where pulp inflammation is transmitted through dentin as hypersensitivity. Clinically, the papilla’s dual role highlights why dentin and pulp are inseparable both functionally and pathologically.",7,,
The dental follicle (sac) gives rise to:,Enamel,Pulp,"Periodontal ligament, cementum, alveolar bone",Stellate reticulum,3,"The dental follicle, also called the dental sac, is ectomesenchymal tissue that surrounds the developing enamel organ and dental papilla. It differentiates into the supporting apparatus of the tooth, known as the periodontium: cementoblasts form cementum, fibroblasts form the periodontal ligament (PDL), and osteoblasts form alveolar bone. These tissues anchor the tooth and absorb occlusal forces. Clinically, the follicle is essential for tooth eruption, guiding bone remodeling to create an eruption pathway and ensuring the integrity of supporting tissues.",7,,
Which cranial nerve is associated with the first pharyngeal (mandibular) arch?,Facial nerve (CN VII),"Trigeminal nerve (CN V2, V3)",Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX),Vagus nerve (CN X),2,"The first pharyngeal arch forms the muscles of mastication (masseter, temporalis, medial/lateral pterygoids), mylohyoid, anterior belly of digastric, tensor tympani, and tensor veli palatini.

Which type of dentin is more highly mineralized?,Intertubular dentin,Peritubular dentin,Secondary dentin,Reparative dentin,2,"Peritubular dentin, also called intratubular dentin, forms the lining of dentinal tubules and is the most highly mineralized dentin (up to 40% more than intertubular dentin). It has less collagen and contributes to sclerosis by narrowing tubule lumens with age. Intertubular dentin makes up the bulk of dentin, is less mineralized, and has more collagen for resilience. Secondary dentin is slowly deposited after root formation, while reparative (tertiary) dentin is formed irregularly in response to injury or caries. High-yield: Peritubular dentin is the most calcified dentin in the tooth.",7,,
Which of the following cell types is not normally found in the dental pulp?,Odontoblasts,Fibroblasts,Cementoblasts,Dendritic cells,3,"The dental pulp is a soft connective tissue specialized for dentin formation and immune defense. Its most important cells are odontoblasts, which line the periphery and form dentin. Fibroblasts are the most numerous cells and produce pulp collagen (types I and III). Dendritic cells act as antigen-presenting cells, and macrophages, lymphocytes, and occasional mast cells provide immune surveillance. Pulp also contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and sensory and autonomic nerve fibers. Cementoblasts, however, are not pulp cells; they reside on the surface of the tooth root in the periodontal ligament and produce cementum. High-yield review: Pulp cells include odontoblasts, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and mast cells (rare). Cementoblasts are absent in pulp. Pulp also functions in dentin formation, nutrition, sensation, and defense.",7,,
"Which phase of the cell cycle is the longest, involving cell growth and preparation for DNA replication?",S phase,G1 phase,G2 phase,M phase,2,"The G1 phase (Gap 1) is usually the longest phase of the cell cycle. During this time, the cell is metabolically active, producing mRNA and proteins needed for DNA synthesis. Organelles increase in number, and the cell grows in size. Importantly, this is the phase where the cell assesses whether conditions are favorable to proceed into the replication stage. At the G1/S checkpoint, tumor suppressors such as p53 and Rb verify DNA integrity and nutrient availability. High-yield: G1 = cell growth, RNA and protein synthesis; longest phase; checkpoint ensures DNA is undamaged before entering S.",7,,
In which phase of the cell cycle does DNA replication occur?,G1 phase,S phase,G2 phase,M phase,2,"The S phase (Synthesis phase) is the period in which the cell replicates its entire genome, producing two identical sets of DNA. Alongside DNA synthesis, histones are manufactured so that new DNA strands can be properly packaged into nucleosomes. Each chromosome, once duplicated, consists of two identical sister chromatids joined at the centromere. This phase is critical for maintaining genetic stability, as replication errors that escape repair can lead to mutations or cancer. High-yield: S = DNA and histone synthesis; genome doubles; chromosomes become sister chromatids; errors here can lead to genomic instability.",7,,
"Which phase of the cell cycle is the shortest, where the actual process of cell division occurs?",S phase,G1 phase,M phase,G2 phase,3,"The M phase (Mitosis) is the shortest but most dramatic stage of the cell cycle. It consists of prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis. During this period, the replicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and distributed into two daughter cells. The fidelity of this process is monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint, which ensures chromosomes are properly attached to spindle fibers before segregation. While short, mistakes during M phase can result in aneuploidy and are implicated in cancer progression. High-yield: M = shortest phase; involves prophase → metaphase → anaphase → telophase + cytokinesis; spindle checkpoint prevents chromosome missegregation.",7,,
Which histological feature distinguishes the parotid gland from the sublingual gland?,Parotid = mucous acini with pale cytoplasm,Parotid = serous acini with eosinophilic cytoplasm,Sublingual = predominantly serous acini with zymogen granules,Sublingual = serous acini with central nuclei,2,"The parotid gland is composed almost entirely of serous acini, which contain abundant zymogen granules. These granules are rich in digestive enzymes, giving the cytoplasm a dark eosinophilic (pink) staining in H&E sections. The nuclei of serous acinar cells are typically round and centrally located. In contrast, the sublingual gland is predominantly mucous acini, which have a pale, foamy, or bubbly appearance due to mucin content that does not stain well with H&E. The nuclei of mucous cells are flattened and pushed to the periphery. High-yield: Parotid = purely serous; Sublingual = mostly mucous; Submandibular = mixed (predominantly serous).",7,,
Which lymphoid organ contains both afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels?,Thymus,Spleen,Lymph node,Tonsil,3,"A lymph node is the only lymphoid organ with both afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels. Afferent vessels carry lymph into the node, where it passes through the cortex and medulla for immune surveillance by lymphocytes and macrophages, before exiting via efferent vessels at the hilum. In contrast, the spleen and thymus have only efferent lymphatic vessels. The spleen filters blood rather than lymph and therefore does not need afferent input. The thymus functions as the site of T-cell maturation, not lymph filtration. Tonsils are partially encapsulated and receive antigen directly through their epithelium. High-yield: Lymph node = afferent + efferent; Spleen/thymus = efferent only; Tonsils = none.",7,,
Each of the following structures pass through the foramen lacerum EXCEPT:,Artery of the pterygoid canal,Nerve of the pterygoid canal (Vidian nerve),Maxillary artery,Emissary veins,3,"The foramen lacerum is located at the base of the skull, bordered by the sphenoid, temporal, and occipital bones. It is filled with cartilage in life and serves as a passage for several small structures, but not the maxillary artery. The artery of the pterygoid canal passes through, as does the nerve of the pterygoid canal, formed by the greater petrosal nerve (parasympathetic) and deep petrosal nerve (sympathetic). Emissary veins may also traverse this region. The maxillary artery instead courses through the infratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae to supply the maxilla, nasal cavity, and dura. High-yield: Foramen lacerum = nerve of pterygoid canal, artery of pterygoid canal, emissary veins; NOT the maxillary artery.",7,,
A patient presents with difficulty raising his shoulders against resistance. Injury to which nerve is most likely responsible?,Axillary nerve,Long thoracic nerve,Spinal accessory nerve,Dorsal scapular nerve,3,"Shoulder elevation is performed mainly by the trapezius muscle, which is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI). Damage leads to shoulder droop and difficulty shrugging shoulders against resistance. The axillary nerve supplies the deltoid (arm abduction 15–90°), the long thoracic nerve supplies the serratus anterior (stabilizes scapula; injury causes winged scapula), and the dorsal scapular nerve supplies rhomboids and levator scapulae (scapular retraction and elevation). 👉 High-yield review: Spinal accessory → shoulder shrug; Axillary → deltoid; Long thoracic → serratus anterior; Dorsal scapular → rhomboids/levator scapulae.",7,,
A patient cannot abduct his arm beyond 15°. Which nerve is most likely injured?,Axillary nerve,Suprascapular nerve,Long thoracic nerve,Thoracodorsal nerve,1,"The deltoid muscle, innervated by the axillary nerve (C5–C6), is responsible for abduction of the arm from 15° to 90°. The supraspinatus (suprascapular nerve) initiates abduction from 0–15°, while abduction above 90° requires scapular rotation via the serratus anterior (long thoracic nerve) and trapezius (spinal accessory nerve). Injury to the axillary nerve causes loss of abduction beyond 15° and sensory loss over the deltoid region. 👉 High-yield review: Supraspinatus → initiates abduction; Deltoid (axillary) → 15–90°; Serratus anterior/trapezius → above 90°; Thoracodorsal (latissimus dorsi) → adduction/extension/internal rotation.",7,,
Which foramen transmits preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the lesser petrosal nerve?,Foramen spinosum,Foramen lacerum,Foramen ovale,Jugular foramen,3,"The **foramen ovale** of the sphenoid bone transmits the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3), the accessory meningeal artery, the emissary vein from the cavernous sinus, and the **lesser petrosal nerve** carrying preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the **otic ganglion**. After synapsing, postganglionic fibers innervate the parotid gland via the auriculotemporal nerve. By contrast, the foramen spinosum carries the middle meningeal artery, the foramen lacerum is filled with cartilage in life, and the jugular foramen carries CN IX, X, XI and the internal jugular vein.

👉 High-yield fact: “Ovale” = **Otic ganglion, V3, Accessory meningeal artery, Lesser petrosal nerve, Emissary vein**.",7,,
Which embryologic processes give rise to the palate?,Lateral nasal and medial nasal processes,Medial nasal and maxillary processes,Maxillary and mandibular processes,Medial nasal and lateral palatine processes,2,"The palate develops from the **medial nasal process** (primary palate and philtrum of the lip) and the **maxillary processes** (secondary palate). Failure of fusion causes cleft lip/palate. In the adult, the hard palate is formed by the **palatine processes of the maxilla** and the **horizontal plates of the palatine bones**.

👉 High-yield fact: Primary palate = medial nasal; Secondary palate = maxillary shelves.",7,,
The ureter is derived from which embryologic tissue?,Endoderm,Mesoderm,Ectoderm,Neural crest,2,"The **ureter** develops from mesoderm, specifically the ureteric bud from the mesonephric duct. In contrast, the **bladder and urethra** arise from endoderm (urogenital sinus). This distinction is frequently tested in embryology.

👉 High-yield fact: Mesoderm → ureter, kidney; Endoderm → bladder, urethra epithelium; Ectoderm → distal anal canal, skin.",7,,
Which lymph nodes lie adjacent to the external jugular vein?,Deep cervical nodes,Superficial cervical nodes,Submandibular nodes,Retropharyngeal nodes,2,"The **superficial cervical lymph nodes** run along the **external jugular vein**, usually in the posterior triangle. They drain into the deep cervical nodes, which run along the internal jugular vein. Submandibular nodes drain oral cavity structures, while retropharyngeal nodes drain the pharynx/nasal cavity.

👉 High-yield fact: Superficial cervical nodes → external jugular; Deep cervical nodes → internal jugular.",7,,
Which arteries supply the thyroid gland?,Ascending pharyngeal and superior thyroid arteries,Superior thyroid and thyrocervical trunk,Superior thyroid and middle meningeal arteries,Lingual and superior thyroid arteries,2,"The thyroid gland receives blood from two major sources: the **superior thyroid artery** (branch of external carotid) and the **inferior thyroid artery** (branch of the thyrocervical trunk from subclavian). Ascending pharyngeal does not supply it. Clinically important: superior thyroid artery is near the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve; inferior thyroid artery is near the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

👉 High-yield fact: Superior thyroid = external carotid; Inferior thyroid = thyrocervical trunk.",7,,
Which bone cells undergo mitosis most frequently?,Osteoblasts,Osteoclasts,Osteocytes,Osteoprogenitor (osteogenic) cells,4,"Bone tissue is dynamic, constantly undergoing <b>remodeling</b> — a balance of <b>bone resorption</b> and <b>bone apposition</b>. <b>Osteoclasts</b> are large, multinucleated cells derived from hematopoietic precursors (monocyte/macrophage lineage). They resorb bone by secreting acid and proteolytic enzymes. Their differentiation and activity are regulated by the <b>RANK–RANKL–OPG pathway</b>: osteoblasts express RANKL, which binds RANK on pre-osteoclasts to stimulate maturation; osteoprotegerin (OPG) serves as a decoy receptor to inhibit this. <b>Osteoblasts</b> are bone-forming cells derived from mesenchymal stem cells. They secrete osteoid (collagen + ground substance) that mineralizes into bone. Once embedded, they become <b>osteocytes</b>. <b>Osteocytes</b> are mature, mechanosensory cells in lacunae that regulate bone turnover through canaliculi signaling. <b>Osteoprogenitor (osteogenic) cells</b> are stem-like precursors in the periosteum and endosteum. They are the <b>only bone cells that retain the ability to divide (mitosis)</b> and give rise to osteoblasts. <b>High-yield points:</b> Osteoprogenitor cells = only mitotic bone cells. RANK–RANKL–OPG pathway regulates osteoclasts. Bone remodeling = osteoclast resorption + osteoblast deposition.",7,,
Which intercellular junction is also known as a “zona occludens”?,Desmosome,Gap junction,Tight junction,Adherens junction,3,"Epithelial cells are connected by specialized junctions that maintain structural integrity and regulate communication. <b>Tight junctions (zonula occludens)</b> are apical belt-like junctions that form a seal preventing paracellular passage of solutes. They are composed of proteins like <b>claudins</b> and <b>occludins</b> and maintain polarity of apical vs. basolateral membranes. <b>Adherens junctions (zonula adherens)</b> are located just below tight junctions, linking actin filaments between cells via cadherins and catenins. <b>Desmosomes (macula adherens)</b> are “spot welds” connecting intermediate filaments (keratin) between cells, providing tensile strength. <b>Gap junctions (nexus)</b> are formed by connexins, allowing passage of ions and small molecules for electrical and metabolic coupling. <b>High-yield points:</b> Zona occludens = tight junction. Zona adherens = adherens junction. Macula adherens = desmosome. Nexus = gap junction.",7,,
The midbrain develops from which primary brain vesicle?,Prosencephalon,Mesencephalon,Rhombencephalon,Telencephalon,2,"Neural development begins with three primary brain vesicles: <b>Prosencephalon (forebrain)</b> → divides into <b>telencephalon</b> (cerebral hemispheres) and <b>diencephalon</b> (thalamus, hypothalamus). <b>Mesencephalon (midbrain)</b> → does not subdivide and directly forms the midbrain. <b>Rhombencephalon (hindbrain)</b> → divides into <b>metencephalon</b> (pons, cerebellum) and <b>myelencephalon</b> (medulla).

Somatosensory information from the oral–facial region is processed in which structure(s)?,Thalamus only,Somatosensory cortex only,Both thalamus and somatosensory cortex,Brainstem only,3,"Sensory input from the face and oral cavity is transmitted primarily via the <b>trigeminal nerve (CN V)</b>. First-order neurons in the trigeminal ganglion project to the trigeminal sensory nuclei in the brainstem. Second-order neurons cross and ascend via the <b>trigeminothalamic tract</b> to the <b>ventral posteromedial (VPM) nucleus</b> of the thalamus. Third-order neurons project from the thalamus to the <b>primary somatosensory cortex</b> (postcentral gyrus, Brodmann areas 3,1,2) for conscious perception. Thus, somatosensory information from the oral–facial region is relayed through the <b>thalamus</b> and processed in the <b>somatosensory cortex</b>. <b>High-yield points:</b> Pathway = trigeminal nerve → brainstem nuclei → trigeminothalamic tract → VPM thalamus → somatosensory cortex. Thalamus = relay; cortex = conscious perception.",7,,
Which statement best describes the tunica media of blood vessels?,It is thick in veins and thin in arteries.,It is thick in arteries and thin in veins.,It is identical in thickness between arteries and veins.,It is absent in both arteries and veins.,2,"Blood vessels are composed of three concentric layers: <b>Tunica intima</b> = endothelium + subendothelial connective tissue + internal elastic lamina. <b>Tunica media</b> = smooth muscle + elastic fibers; <b>much thicker in arteries</b> to withstand high pressure and regulate vascular tone. <b>Tunica adventitia</b> = connective tissue with vasa vasorum and nerves; <b>thicker in veins</b> than arteries. Thus, arteries have a thick tunica media, while veins have a thicker adventitia. <b>High-yield points:</b> Tunica media = thicker in arteries. Veins = thinner media, thicker adventitia. Arteries = maintain blood pressure and flow.",7,,
Which nerve fiber types are correctly matched with their sensory modalities in tooth innervation?,"A-alpha: proprioception; A-beta: touch & pressure; A-delta: acute pain & temperature; C fibers: dull, burning pain & temperature",A-alpha: touch; A-beta: proprioception; A-delta: dull pain; C fibers: acute pain,A-alpha: proprioception; A-beta: vibration only; A-delta: temperature only; C fibers: pressure,A-alpha: proprioception; A-beta: proprioception; A-delta: pressure; C fibers: vibration,1,"The dental pulp is innervated by several classes of sensory fibers, each differing in diameter, conduction speed, and function. <b>A-alpha fibers</b> are the largest, fastest-conducting fibers and primarily mediate <b>proprioception</b>, such as detecting occlusal load and jaw position. <b>A-beta fibers</b> are slightly smaller, rapidly conducting fibers that transmit <b>touch and pressure</b> sensations. <b>A-delta fibers</b> are thinly myelinated fibers that conduct at intermediate speeds. They are responsible for <b>acute, sharp pain and temperature</b> detection. Clinically, they account for the immediate sharp pain in dentin hypersensitivity or reversible pulpitis. <b>C fibers</b> are unmyelinated, slow-conducting fibers. They transmit <b>dull, burning, throbbing pain and temperature</b> sensations. Clinically, they are associated with lingering pain, such as that experienced in irreversible pulpitis or pulpal necrosis. This classification highlights how the pulp can transmit both protective acute pain and chronic pain, allowing dentists to correlate symptoms with pulp status. <b>High-yield points:</b> A-alpha = proprioception (fastest). A-beta = touch & pressure. A-delta = sharp, acute pain & temperature. C fibers = dull, burning, throbbing pain & temperature. <b>Clinical correlation:</b> A-delta → sharp quick pain; C fibers → lingering throbbing pain.",7,,
