"In a normal (Gaussian) distribution, approximately what percentage of observations fall within ±1 standard deviation (SD) from the mean?",34%,68%,95%,99.70%,2,"<b>Normal distribution</b> describes a symmetrical bell‑shaped curve in which data are evenly distributed about the mean, median, and mode (all equal). Each standard deviation (SD) represents a fixed interval from the mean. In a perfectly normal distribution:<br><br>• ≈ 68% of values lie within ± 1 SD.<br>• ≈ 95% within ± 2 SD.<br>• ≈ 99.7% within ± 3 SD.<br><br>This pattern is known as the <b>empirical rule (68‑95‑99.7 rule)</b>.<br><br><b>High‑yield recap:</b><br>✅ 68% → ±1 SD ✅ 95% → ±2 SD ✅ 99.7% → ±3 SD.",17,,
Approximately what percentage of observations lie outside ±2 SD from the mean in a normal distribution?,2.50%,5%,10%,32%,2,"If 95% of data lie within ± 2 SD, the remaining 5% fall outside — 2.5% below –2 SD and 2.5% above +2 SD.<br><br>Values beyond ± 2 SD are considered <b>statistically unusual</b>; those beyond ± 3 SD (≈ 0.3%) are <b>outliers</b>.<br><br><b>High‑yield recap:</b><br>✅ ± 1 SD → 68% inside, 32% outside.<br>✅ ± 2 SD → 95% inside, 5% outside.<br>✅ ± 3 SD → 99.7% inside, 0.3% outside.",17,,
"In a dataset of dental exam scores with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10, approximately what range contains 95% of all scores if the data are normally distributed?",60 – 80,50 – 90,40 – 100,30 – 110,2,"In a normal distribution, 95% of data lie within ± 2 SD. Thus, 70 ± (2 × 10) = <b>50 to 90</b>.<br><br>This interval contains nearly all observations, while only ≈ 5% fall outside (≈ 2.5% on each tail).",17,,
A researcher notes that a data set has a mean = 50 and median = 40. What can be inferred about the shape of its distribution?,Symmetrical,Negatively skewed,Positively skewed,Uniform,3,"When the <b>mean &gt; median &gt; mode</b>, the distribution is <b>positively (right) skewed</b> — a long right‑hand tail caused by a few large values.<br><br>Conversely, <b>mean &lt; median &lt; mode → negative (left) skew</b>. Normal distribution occurs when all three are equal.<br><br><b>High‑yield recap:</b><br>✅ Mean &gt; Median → Right skew.<br>✅ Mean &lt; Median → Left skew.<br>✅ Mean = Median = Mode → Normal curve.",17,,
Which of the following statistical tests compares the means of two independent groups to determine if they differ significantly?,Paired t-test,Student’s t-test,ANOVA,Chi-square test,2,"The <b>Student’s t-test</b> (independent t-test) compares the <b>means between two independent, unrelated samples</b> — for example, comparing the mean blood pressure of males vs females.<br><br>
It determines whether the difference between two group means is statistically significant, assuming normally distributed data and equal variances.<br><br>
- <b>Paired t-test:</b> used for related samples (same subjects before & after treatment).<br>
- <b>ANOVA:</b> compares ≥ 3 groups.<br>
- <b>Chi-square:</b> compares categorical frequencies, not means.",17,,
A researcher measures probing depths before and after periodontal therapy in the same group of patients. Which statistical test should be used?,Student’s t-test,Paired t-test,ANOVA,Chi-square test,2,"The <b>Paired t-test</b> compares <b>two related means</b> — when the same subjects are tested twice (pre- vs post-intervention). It accounts for <b>intra-subject correlation</b>, isolating the treatment effect.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> mean CAL before vs after scaling and root planing.<br>
It differs from the independent t-test because both data sets come from the <b>same sample population</b>.",17,,
Which of the following tests is most appropriate when comparing the means of three or more independent groups?,Paired t-test,Student’s t-test,ANOVA,Chi-square test,3,"<b>ANOVA</b> (Analysis of Variance) compares <b>means across three or more groups</b> to determine if at least one mean differs significantly. It extends the t-test concept to multiple groups while controlling the overall Type I error rate.<br><br>
If ANOVA shows a significant result, <b>post-hoc tests</b> (e.g., Tukey’s HSD) identify which specific groups differ.<br><br>
- <b>One-way ANOVA:</b> one independent variable.<br>
- <b>Two-way ANOVA:</b> two independent variables (e.g., treatment × gender).",17,,
"Which of the following tests is best used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables (e.g., smoking status and presence of periodontitis)?",Student’s t-test,ANOVA,Paired t-test,Chi-square test,4,"The <b>Chi-square (χ²) test</b> assesses whether an observed frequency distribution differs from what is expected by chance — it tests for <b>associations between categorical variables</b>.<br><br>
It is used on <b>nominal data</b> (counts or percentages), not continuous data like means or standard deviations.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> frequency of periodontitis among smokers vs non-smokers.<br>
A significant χ² value → association exists between variables, but it does not indicate direction or strength.",17,,
