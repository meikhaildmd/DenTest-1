<b>Overview:</b><br>
Persistent or lingering pain after an apparently completed root canal most often indicates <b>persistent intraradicular infection</b>—commonly due to a <b>missed canal</b> or <b>incomplete cleaning and shaping</b>.<br><br>
<b>Common Causes:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Missed canal:</b> Residual necrotic tissue or bacteria remain in untreated canal (most common cause).</li>
<li><b>Incomplete debridement:</b> Apical or lateral canal remnants harbor infection.</li>
<li><b>Cracked root:</b> Can mimic endodontic failure but usually shows isolated probing defect.</li>
<li><b>Overextension of materials:</b> May cause short-term pain, but not lingering chronic symptoms.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Most Frequently Missed Canals (High-Yield):</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Maxillary first molar:</b> Mesiobuccal root often contains a <b>second canal (MB2)</b>.</li>
<li><b>Mandibular first molar:</b> <b>Distal root</b> may contain <b>two canals (DB and DL)</b> instead of one.</li>
<li><b>Mandibular lateral incisor:</b> Often has <b>two canals (facial and lingual)</b> that merge apically — the <b>lingual canal</b> is commonly missed.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Diagnosis:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Persistent percussion tenderness</b> after obturation.</li>
<li>Periapical radiolucency that fails to resolve.</li>
<li><b>CBCT</b> imaging often reveals missed canal or incomplete fill.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Management:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Retreatment</b> of the root canal system, locating all canals with magnification and CBCT guidance.</li>
<li>Occasionally <b>apicoectomy</b> if persistent periapical lesion remains.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>High-Yield Summary:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Most likely cause:</b> Missed canal → persistent infection.</li>
<li><b>Common sites:</b> MB2 (max 1st molar), distal root (mand 1st molar), lingual canal (mand lateral incisor).</li>
<li><b>Diagnosis:</b> CBCT and careful exploration under magnification.</li>

What is the most common complication associated with internal (nonvital) tooth bleaching?,Crown fracture,Pulpal necrosis,Cervical root resorption,Enamel hypocalcification,3,"<b>Complication of Internal (Nonvital) Bleaching – Cervical Root Resorption</b><br><br>
<b>Overview:</b><br>
Internal bleaching is performed on <b>endodontically treated teeth</b> to correct discoloration due to pulpal necrosis or restorative materials.  
Although effective, it carries the risk of <b>external cervical root resorption (ECR)</b>, especially when high-concentration oxidizing agents are used.<br><br>
<b>Pathogenesis:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Penetration of <b>hydrogen peroxide</b> and oxygen radicals through dentinal tubules into the <b>periodontal ligament</b>.</li>
<li>This triggers an <b>inflammatory resorptive response</b> from odontoclasts at the cervical root surface.</li>
<li>More likely if there’s <b>loss of cementum</b> or <b>heat activation</b> during bleaching.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Risk Factors:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Use of <b>30–35% hydrogen peroxide</b> instead of sodium perborate-water mix.</li>
<li>Previous trauma (microcracks or cemental defects).</li>
<li>Inadequate <b>barrier placement</b> over gutta-percha below CEJ.</li>
<li>Heat application during bleaching.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Prevention:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Always seal canal orifice with <b>2 mm glass ionomer barrier</b> below CEJ.</li>
<li>Prefer <b>sodium perborate + water</b> rather than high-concentration peroxides.</li>
<li>Avoid heat-activated techniques.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>High-Yield Summary:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Most common complication:</b> Cervical root resorption (external).</li>
<li><b>Cause:</b> Diffusion of peroxide into PDL → inflammatory resorption.</li>
<li><b>Prevention:</b> Use sodium perborate + water and proper cervical seal.</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> Risk is higher in teeth with previous trauma.</li>

Which clinical test is most helpful in differentiating endodontic pain from periodontal pain?,Percussion test,Palpation test,Transillumination,Cold test,1,"<b>Endodontic vs Periodontal Pain – Diagnostic Differentiation</b><br><br>
<b>Overview:</b><br>
Endodontic and periodontal diseases can produce similar symptoms, but their <b>origins and pain patterns differ</b>.  
The <b>percussion test</b> is one of the simplest and most reliable methods to help differentiate the two.<br><br>
<b>Percussion Test Principle:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Vertical percussion:</b> Stresses the <b>apex</b> and indicates <b>endodontic (periapical)</b> inflammation.</li>
<li><b>Lateral percussion or pressure:</b> Stresses the <b>periodontal ligament</b> and indicates <b>periodontal</b> inflammation.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Additional Diagnostic Clues:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Endodontic origin:</b> Non-vital pulp (negative to cold test), localized radiolucency at apex.</li>
<li><b>Periodontal origin:</b> Vital pulp (normal response), generalized bone loss, pocket formation.</li>
<li>Combined lesions may show overlapping signs — pulp testing and probing help confirm.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>High-Yield Summary:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Best initial test:</b> Percussion (vertical = endo, lateral = perio).</li>
<li><b>Endo pain:</b> Sharp, lingering, periapical tenderness, nonvital pulp.</li>
<li><b>Perio pain:</b> Dull, pressure-like, mobility, deep pockets, vital pulp.</li>
<li><b>Confirm with:</b> Pulp vitality tests and probing depths.</li>

A patient reports lingering pain lasting more than 20 seconds after a cold test is applied to a tooth. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Reversible pulpitis,Irreversible pulpitis,Pulpal necrosis,Normal pulp response,2,"<b>Pulp Vitality Testing – Lingering Pain After Cold</b><br><br>
<b>Overview:</b><br>
Thermal testing (usually with refrigerant spray or CO₂ snow) helps determine pulp vitality and inflammation.  
The <b>duration and intensity</b> of the response are key indicators of pulpal status.<br><br>
<b>Typical Responses:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Normal pulp:</b> Sharp pain that subsides immediately when the stimulus is removed.</li>
<li><b>Reversible pulpitis:</b> Brief, sharp pain (<b><10 seconds</b>) that disappears once the stimulus is gone.</li>

<li><b>Necrotic pulp:</b> <b>No response</b> to cold or electric pulp test.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Mechanism:</b><br>
In irreversible pulpitis, inflamed pulp tissue has <b>elevated intrapulpal pressure</b> and <b>damaged A-delta and C fibers</b> that continue firing after the stimulus is removed.<br><br>
<b>Clinical Features:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Spontaneous pain, especially at night.</li>

<b>Overview:</b><br>
A vertical root fracture (VRF) is a <b>longitudinal crack extending from the root canal to the external root surface</b>.  
It is often seen in <b>previously root canal–treated teeth</b> and represents one of the most challenging endodontic failures.<br><br>
<b>Etiology:</b><br>
