Which of the following correctly matches the cell type with its primary function?,Leydig cells → sperm maturation,Sertoli cells → testosterone production,Granulosa cells → estrogen synthesis,Theca cells → ovulation trigger,3,"The gonads contain specialized supporting cells that regulate gametogenesis and hormone production, controlled by pituitary gonadotropins (LH, FSH).
        •        Males:
        •        Leydig cells (interstitial): Stimulated by LH → produce testosterone, which diffuses into seminiferous tubules. Testosterone is essential for spermatogenesis and development of secondary sex characteristics.
        •        Sertoli cells (within seminiferous tubules): Stimulated by FSH → support developing sperm, form the blood-testis barrier, secrete androgen-binding protein, and release inhibin B to provide negative feedback on FSH. They also produce anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) during development.
        •        Females:
        •        Granulosa cells: Stimulated by FSH → convert androgens (from theca cells) into estrogens via aromatase. They nurture oocytes and form part of the follicle.
        •        Theca cells: Stimulated by LH → produce androgens and progesterone, important for ovulation and corpus luteum function.

Clinical correlations:
        •        Leydig cell tumors → testosterone excess → precocious puberty in boys.
        •        Sertoli cell tumors → rare, can cause feminization.

An increase in which of the following pressures would most likely cause water to move into the capillaries from the surrounding interstitial fluid?,Capillary hydrostatic pressure,Interstitial hydrostatic pressure,Plasma oncotic pressure,Capillary permeability,3,"Osmotic pressure refers to the pulling force created by solutes that draws water toward the area of higher solute concentration across a semipermeable membrane. 
Within the vascular system, this concept is represented by oncotic pressure, the portion of osmotic pressure generated specifically by plasma proteins (mainly albumin). 
When plasma oncotic pressure increases, water is drawn into the capillaries, opposing the outward push of hydrostatic pressure.<br><br>
Hydrostatic pressure is the pushing force exerted by blood against vessel walls, driving fluid out of the capillaries. Interstitial hydrostatic pressure typically resists filtration by pushing water back into the capillaries but is normally very low. 
Capillary permeability affects how easily water and solutes move but does not itself pull or push fluid — it modifies how the other forces act.<br><br>

Where are sperm cells produced and where are they stored before ejaculation?,Produced in epididymis; stored in seminal vesicles,Produced in seminiferous tubules; stored in epididymis,Produced in vas deferens; stored in prostate gland,Produced in rete testis; stored in urethra,2,"Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules beginning at puberty. Germ cells progress from spermatogonia → spermatocytes → spermatids → spermatozoa, all supported by Sertoli cells and dependent on both FSH and testosterone.
        •        Maturation & storage: Completed spermatozoa are transported to the epididymis, where they mature, gain motility, and are stored until ejaculation.
        •        Transport during ejaculation: Pathway = epididymis → vas deferens → ejaculatory duct → urethra.

Exam trick: Glycine is not ketogenic — it is purely glucogenic, so it cannot generate ketone bodies.

Which enzyme restores oxaloacetate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle?,Succinate dehydrogenase,Fumarase,Malate dehydrogenase,Citrate synthase,3,"The TCA cycle regenerates oxaloacetate (OAA) at the final step, enabling continuation of the cycle.
        •        Malate dehydrogenase: Catalyzes malate → OAA, producing NADH. This step is energetically unfavorable but driven forward by rapid OAA consumption in citrate synthase reaction.
        •        Other enzymes in the cycle:

"In gluconeogenesis, biotin acts as a cofactor for which enzyme?",Pyruvate carboxylase,Pyruvate kinase,Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK),Glucose-6-phosphatase,1,"Biotin (vitamin B7) is an essential coenzyme for carboxylation reactions, meaning it carries activated CO₂ to help form new carbon–carbon bonds. The classic high-yield fact: all carboxylases require biotin.

In gluconeogenesis, the key biotin-dependent enzyme is pyruvate carboxylase, located in the mitochondria. It catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate (3C) → oxaloacetate (OAA, 4C), using CO₂, ATP, and biotin as cofactors. This is the first bypass step of gluconeogenesis, allowing the body to generate glucose from non-carbohydrate sources during fasting.
        •        PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase): Converts OAA → PEP, but requires GTP, not biotin.
        •        Pyruvate kinase: Functions in glycolysis (PEP → pyruvate), not gluconeogenesis.
        •        Glucose-6-phosphatase: Final gluconeogenic enzyme, releasing free glucose into the blood.

Clinical tie-in: Biotin deficiency (rare, can occur with excessive raw egg white ingestion due to avidin) can impair gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, dermatitis, and alopecia.

Which metabolic pathway is the major source of NADPH in cells?,TCA cycle,Pentose phosphate pathway,Glycolysis,Beta-oxidation of fatty acids,2,"The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), also called the hexose monophosphate shunt, is an alternative glucose metabolism pathway that branches from glycolysis at glucose-6-phosphate. It operates in the cytosol and has two major products:
        •        NADPH, a crucial reducing agent used in:
• Reductive biosynthesis (fatty acid, cholesterol, steroid synthesis).
• Maintaining reduced glutathione in red blood cells, which protects against oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species. This is why G6PD deficiency leads to hemolysis.
• Cytochrome P450 hydroxylation reactions, important for detoxification in the liver.
        •        Ribose-5-phosphate, essential for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis.

By contrast:
        •        Glycolysis and the TCA cycle produce NADH, which is used in oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP.
        •        β-oxidation of fatty acids produces NADH and FADH2, feeding into the electron transport chain for energy, but not NADPH.

Which of the following best describes the role of gamma motor neurons in skeletal muscle physiology?,They innervate extrafusal fibers to generate force during contraction.,They regulate intrafusal muscle spindle sensitivity to stretch.,They mediate inhibition of antagonist muscles through reciprocal innervation.,They activate Golgi tendon organs to sense tension.,2,"Skeletal muscle fibers are divided into extrafusal fibers, which generate force, and intrafusal fibers, which are housed in muscle spindles and detect stretch. Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal fibers and adjust their baseline tension, setting the gain of the stretch reflex. This ensures spindles remain sensitive even when the muscle shortens, allowing regulation of muscle tone and length. In contrast, alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal fibers to produce force. Reciprocal innervation involves inhibitory interneurons mediated via Ia afferents, not gamma motor neurons. Golgi tendon organs sense tension and are not activated by gamma motor neurons.

👉 High-yield review:

"Here are two statements about nitrogen metabolism:
