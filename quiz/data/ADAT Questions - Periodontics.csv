Which of the following best describes the goal of guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in periodontal therapy?,Promote rapid epithelial migration to close the defect,Encourage bone fill without involving periodontal ligament cells,Replace damaged gingival connective tissue with scar tissue,Use a membrane barrier to allow for periodontal ligament cells to regenerate the attachment apparatus,4,"<b>Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR)</b><br><br>GTR is a periodontal surgical technique aimed at regenerating the <b>alveolar bone, cementum, and periodontal ligament (PDL)</b> that support the tooth. The procedure uses a <b>barrier membrane</b> to exclude fast-migrating epithelial and gingival connective tissue cells, allowing slower-growing PDL and bone cells to repopulate the defect and establish a <b>true new attachment apparatus</b>.<br><br>Without a barrier, epithelial cells migrate apically and form a <b>long junctional epithelium</b>—a repair process rather than regeneration.<br><br><b>Membrane types:</b><br>- Non-resorbable: ePTFE (requires removal)<br>- Resorbable: collagen, polylactic acid (biodegradable)<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- 🎯 Goal: Regenerate PDL, cementum, and bone<br>- 🚫 Avoid: Epithelial down-growth (long junctional epithelium)<br>- 🧱 Method: Barrier membrane to allow selective cell repopulation",16,,
Which of the following periodontal flap procedures involves full reflection of the mucoperiosteum to allow direct access to the alveolar bone for debridement and osseous reshaping?,Partial-thickness flap,Full-thickness flap,Modified Widman flap,Coronally repositioned flap,2,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><br>A <b>full-thickness flap (mucoperiosteal flap)</b> includes <b>epithelium, connective tissue, and periosteum</b> — the entire soft tissue layer overlying bone. It is reflected using <b>a periosteal elevator</b>, giving <b>direct visibility and access to the alveolar bone</b>.<br><br><b>Steps:</b><br>1. Internal bevel incision near the gingival margin.<br>2. Crevicular incision through the base of the pocket.<br>3. Vertical releasing incisions as needed for access.<br>4. Elevate the flap with a periosteal elevator to expose bone and roots.<br><br><b>Uses:</b><br>• Access for scaling and root planing.<br>• Osseous surgery (e.g., recontouring).<br>• Crown lengthening procedures.<br><br><b>Key concept:</b> When bone correction is required, use a <b>full-thickness flap</b>; when bone should remain covered, use a <b>partial-thickness flap</b>.",16,,
"In a partial-thickness (split-thickness) flap, which structure remains intact over the bone?",Gingival epithelium,Connective tissue,Periosteum,Alveolar crest,3,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><br>A <b>partial-thickness flap</b> reflects only the <b>epithelium and a thin layer of connective tissue</b>, leaving the <b>periosteum attached</b> to the bone. Because the bone is not exposed, this technique is less invasive and helps maintain blood supply.<br><br><b>Procedure:</b><br>1. Sharp dissection through epithelium and part of the connective tissue layer.<br>2. No periosteal elevation — the flap slides on top of the periosteum.<br>3. Usually involves vertical incisions for mobility (e.g., apically repositioned procedures).<br><br><b>Indications:</b><br>• Mucogingival surgery (e.g., increasing attached gingiva).<br>• Root coverage or grafting procedures.<br>• When bone exposure could risk resorption.<br><br><b>Summary:</b><br>• <b>Full-thickness:</b> expose bone → osseous surgery.<br>• <b>Partial-thickness:</b> preserve periosteum → mucogingival surgery.",16,,
Which of the following periodontal flap techniques is primarily used to gain access for root debridement while preserving gingival tissue and minimizing recession?,Apically repositioned flap,Modified Widman flap,Papilla preservation flap,Full-thickness flap,2,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><br>The <b>Modified Widman flap</b> is a <i>conservative</i>, step-by-step flap designed for <b>access, not reshaping</b>. It allows cleaning of the root and removal of diseased pocket epithelium — but without significantly changing the gingival margin.<br><br><b>Procedure:</b><br>1. <b>Internal bevel incision</b> 0.5–1 mm from gingival margin toward the bone.<br>2. <b>Crevicular incision</b> along the pocket wall.<br>3. <b>Interdental incision</b> to remove collar of tissue.<br>4. <b>Flap reflection</b> (usually full-thickness, but minimally).<br>5. <b>Thorough debridement</b> and root planing.<br>6. <b>Flap repositioned</b> at the original level and sutured.<br><br><b>Purpose:</b><br>• Reduce inflammation.<br>• Maintain gingival contour and esthetics.<br>• Promote new attachment.<br><br><b>Quick recall:</b> “Widman = Window” → opens a small, clean window to the roots.",16,,
Which of the following flaps is designed to reduce pocket depth and increase the width of attached gingiva by repositioning the gingiva apically?,Papilla preservation flap,Apically repositioned flap,Modified Widman flap,Envelope flap,2,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><br>The <b>apically repositioned flap</b> moves the gingiva <i>toward the apex</i> to eliminate periodontal pockets and expose more attached tissue.<br><br><b>Procedure:</b><br>1. Two parallel horizontal incisions — one at the gingival margin, one at the base of the pocket.<br>2. Two vertical releasing incisions for mobility.<br>3. Flap reflected (full-thickness).<br>4. After debridement and osseous reshaping, flap is sutured in an apical position.<br><br><b>Result:</b><br>• Pocket elimination.<br>• Wider zone of attached gingiva.<br>• Clinical crown lengthening.<br><br><b>Caution:</b> may cause root sensitivity and esthetic compromise in anterior areas.",16,,
Which of the following statements about the vascular supply of periodontal flaps is TRUE?,Blood flow enters primarily through the gingival margin and travels apically.,The major blood supply of a flap is derived from its free gingival edge.,"The blood supply enters at the flap’s base and moves coronally, so a height-to-base ratio greater than 2:1 risks ischemia.",Increasing flap height relative to its base improves perfusion and healing.,3,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><br>The <b>primary blood supply</b> to a periodontal flap originates from the <b>base</b> and travels <b>coronally</b> toward the margin. Because the vessels enter from the base, maintaining an appropriate <b>height-to-base ratio</b> is critical to ensure perfusion and healing.<br><br><b>Key principle:</b><br>- A long, narrow flap has poor vascularity at its tip due to greater distance from the source vessels.<br>- This leads to <b>ischemia</b>, <b>necrosis</b>, and <b>delayed healing</b> at the flap margins.<br><br><b>Optimal surgical design:</b><br>• The <b>height-to-base ratio</b> should be ≤ <b>2:1</b>.<br>• A wider base provides more robust vascular supply.<br>• In smokers, diabetics, or patients with compromised healing, make the base even broader.<br><br><b>Quick recap:</b><br>- Blood flow: <b>Base → Margin</b><br>- Safe ratio: <b>≤ 2:1</b><br>- Too tall or narrow flaps → <b>poor perfusion</b> and <b>necrosis</b>.",16,,
Where should vertical releasing incisions be placed during periodontal flap surgery to minimize gingival recession and preserve the papilla?,Directly through the center of the interdental papilla,At the line angles of teeth to avoid the papilla,Midway between two teeth for better exposure,On the palatal side for improved visualization,2,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><br><b>Vertical releasing incisions</b> are used to provide <b>additional access and mobility</b> during flap reflection. Their placement is crucial to minimize soft tissue trauma and esthetic defects.<br><br><b>Placement guidelines:</b><br>- Make vertical incisions at the <b>line angles of teeth</b> — not through the papilla.<br>- Avoid the <b>palatal or lingual surfaces</b> where neurovascular structures like the <b>greater palatine</b> and <b>lingual arteries</b> are at risk.<br>- Extend incisions <b>beyond the mucogingival junction</b> to release tension and allow safe flap reflection.<br><br><b>Rationale:</b><br>Incising through the interdental papilla can cause <b>loss of papillary height</b>, <b>black triangles</b>, and <b>gingival recession</b>. Placing them at line angles preserves blood supply and promotes predictable healing.<br><br><b>Tip:</b> Think of a vertical incision as a 'hinge release' — it should increase mobility, not damage vital tissue.",16,,
Which of the following combinations correctly matches the type of flap with the instrument used for its reflection?,Full-thickness flap → sharp dissection with scalpel,Partial-thickness flap → blunt dissection with periosteal elevator,Full-thickness flap → blunt reflection using a periosteal elevator,Partial-thickness flap → elevation using tissue forceps only,3,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><br>The choice of instrument depends on whether the flap is <b>full-thickness (mucoperiosteal)</b> or <b>partial-thickness (split)</b>.<br><br><b>Full-thickness flap:</b><br>- Includes <b>epithelium, connective tissue, and periosteum</b>.<br>- Reflected as one layer using <b>blunt dissection</b> with a <b>periosteal elevator</b>.<br>- Provides direct visualization of alveolar bone — ideal for osseous surgery, debridement, and regenerative procedures.<br><br><b>Partial-thickness flap:</b><br>- Includes <b>epithelium and part of connective tissue</b> only; periosteum remains attached to bone.<br>- Created with <b>sharp dissection</b> using a scalpel (e.g., #15 blade).<br>- Used in <b>mucogingival procedures</b> (e.g., grafting, increasing attached gingiva).<br><br><b>Key distinction:</b><br>• <b>Full = blunt reflection</b><br>• <b>Partial = sharp dissection</b><br><br><b>Summary:</b><br>Proper instrument selection ensures controlled tissue handling, reduced trauma, and optimal healing outcomes.",16,,

Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of low-dose doxycycline (Periostat) therapy in the management of periodontitis?,Directly eliminates subgingival bacteria through bactericidal activity,"Inhibits collagenase (MMP) activity, reducing connective-tissue breakdown",Promotes bone regeneration by stimulating fibroblast proliferation,Neutralizes bacterial endotoxins within the gingival sulcus,2,"Low-dose doxycycline (20 mg twice daily, marketed as <b>Periostat</b>) is an example of <b>host-modulating therapy</b>. 
Unlike conventional antimicrobial doses, it does <b>not act as an antibiotic</b>. Instead, it targets the <b>host’s destructive inflammatory response</b>, specifically by inhibiting <b>matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)</b>—notably <b>collagenase (MMP-8 and MMP-9)</b>—which are responsible for collagen degradation in periodontal connective tissue.<br><br>
<b>Mechanism and key points:</b><br>
• <b>Sub-antimicrobial dose:</b> Too low to suppress bacterial growth, thus minimizing resistance risk.<br>
• <b>MMP inhibition:</b> Reduces breakdown of collagen fibers and slows attachment loss.<br>
• <b>Anti-inflammatory modulation:</b> Decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α.<br>
• <b>Adjunctive role:</b> Used alongside mechanical debridement (scaling + root planing).<br><br>
<b>Local adjunctive therapies:</b><br>
• <b>PerioChip:</b> Chlorhexidine 2.5 mg inserted into pockets ≥5 mm, releasing antiseptic for ~7 days.<br>
• <b>Arestin:</b> Minocycline 1 mg microspheres.<br>
• <b>Atridox:</b> Doxycycline 10% gel.<br><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Sub-antimicrobial doxycycline targets host enzymes (MMPs) and reduces connective tissue destruction rather than bacterial growth.",16,,

Which of the following is a contraindication for performing a gingivectomy?,Shallow suprabony pockets with adequate keratinized gingiva,Lack of keratinized attached gingiva,Elimination of gingival enlargement,Crown lengthening for restorative purposes,2,"A <b>gingivectomy</b> is a surgical procedure performed to remove and reshape loose, diseased gingival tissue to eliminate suprabony pockets or excessive gingival overgrowth. It is indicated when pockets are entirely above the alveolar crest and adequate keratinized tissue is present.<br><br>
<b>Indications:</b><br>
- Elimination of suprabony pockets and pseudo pockets<br>
- Gingival enlargement due to drugs (phenytoin, nifedipine, cyclosporine) or inflammation<br>
- Crown lengthening for restorative access (when sufficient keratinized tissue remains)<br><br>
<b>Contraindications:</b><br>
- <b>Lack of adequate keratinized gingiva</b> — removal may leave alveolar mucosa exposed, leading to discomfort and poor healing.<br>
- <b>Infrabony pockets</b> — since bone recontouring would be required.<br>
- Areas with esthetic concern (e.g., anterior maxilla).<br><br>
<b>High-yield recap:</b><br>
- Gingivectomy treats <b>suprabony</b> defects only.<br>
- Infrabony pockets → require flap surgery.<br>
- Never perform when keratinized tissue is insufficient — can result in mucogingival defects and poor patient comfort.",16,,
"Which of the following best describes the difference between osteoplasty, ostectomy, and osteotomy?",Osteoplasty involves removing supporting bone around teeth,Ostectomy involves reshaping non-supporting bone,Osteotomy involves sectioning bone to reposition or align it,Osteoplasty involves reshaping non-supporting bone without removing attachment-supporting bone,4,"In periodontal and osseous surgery, it is essential to distinguish between these terms to properly describe bone manipulation techniques.<br><br>
<b>Osteoplasty:</b> Reshaping of <b>non-supporting bone</b> (bone not directly involved in tooth attachment). This procedure improves physiologic contour without altering bone height around the teeth. Often used to correct thick ledges or exostoses.<br><br>
<b>Ostectomy:</b> Removal of <b>supporting bone</b> — bone that is part of the tooth’s attachment apparatus. It is done to eliminate bony ledges or intrabony defects and restore physiologic bone contour.<br><br>
<b>Osteotomy:</b> A broader surgical term referring to <b>sectioning or cutting bone</b> to change its alignment or position — often used in orthognathic surgery or implant placement contexts.<br><br>
<b>High-yield recap:</b><br>
- <b>Osteoplasty</b> → reshaping non-supporting bone (cosmetic/contour correction).<br>

Which of the following best describes **positive bony architecture** in periodontics?,The interdental bone crest is apical to the facial and lingual crests,The interdental bone crest is at the same level as the facial and lingual crests,The interdental bone crest is coronal to the facial and lingual crests,The interdental bone crest is absent or resorbed entirely,3,"Positive architecture refers to the situation where the **crest of interdental bone is coronal** to the facial and lingual alveolar bone crest, creating a natural scalloped contour that follows the CEJ of adjacent teeth. <br><br>
Flat architecture occurs when the **interdental bone crest is at the same level** as the facial and lingual bone margins, while **negative (reverse) architecture** refers to the interdental bone crest being **apical** to the facial and lingual crests. <br><br>
The goal of **osseous resective surgery** is to eliminate **negative architecture**, restoring a physiologic, positive bone contour that supports the gingiva and prevents deep pocketing. <br><br>

• Junctional epithelium ≈ 0.97 mm<br>
• Connective tissue attachment ≈ 1.07 mm<br>
<b>Total = ~2.04 mm</b><br><br>
Violation of biologic width by placing restorative margins too close to the bone crest results in **chronic inflammation**, **bone loss**, and **gingival recession**. <br><br>

Which of the following correctly distinguishes a connective tissue graft (CTG) from a free gingival graft (FGG)?,"CTG is mainly used to increase the zone of keratinized gingiva, while FGG is primarily for root coverage",FGG provides superior esthetics compared to CTG,CTG offers better color blend and blood supply than FGG,FGG requires a smaller donor site and has less postoperative discomfort than CTG,3,"<b>Free Gingival Graft (FGG):</b><br>
• Composed of epithelium + connective tissue<br>
• Increases keratinized gingiva; not primarily esthetic<br>
• Poor color match, less vascular, more discomfort<br><br>

• Connective tissue only (no epithelium)<br>
• Used for root coverage and esthetic areas<br>
• Superior color match, double blood supply, high predictability<br><br>

Which of the following periodontal procedures heals primarily by secondary intention?,Flap surgery,Gingivectomy,Connective tissue graft,Flap closure after implant placement,2,"<b>Primary Intention:</b> Wound edges are approximated and sutured. Healing is rapid, minimal scarring.<br>
Examples: flap surgery, sutured incisions, implant closure.<br><br>
<b>Secondary Intention:</b> Wound edges are left open; granulation tissue forms followed by epithelialization. Healing is slower with more scar tissue.<br>
Examples: <b>Gingivectomy</b>, extraction sockets, resective osseous surgery.<br><br>
<b>Clinical Tip:</b> Gingivectomy heals by granulation and epithelial migration over exposed connective tissue — a hallmark of secondary intention healing.",16,,
