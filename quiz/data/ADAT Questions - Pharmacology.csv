"Which antibiotic inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, blocking translocation and tRNA release?",Penicillin,Azithromycin,Ciprofloxacin,Tetracycline,2,"Macrolides such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin act by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, where they block the translocation step of protein synthesis. This prevents elongation of the peptide chain and inhibits bacterial growth; macrolides are typically bacteriostatic but can be bactericidal at high concentrations. In contrast, penicillins disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibiting peptidoglycan cross-linking. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, inhibits DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV, impairing DNA replication. Tetracyclines bind to the 30S subunit and block aminoacyl-tRNA attachment, halting protein elongation. High-yield: Macrolides (50S) block translocation; Tetracyclines (30S) block tRNA binding; Aminoglycosides (30S) cause misreading of mRNA; Chloramphenicol (50S) inhibits peptidyl transferase; Linezolid (50S) prevents initiation complex.",9,,
Which drug is most strongly associated with the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw?,Furosemide,Hydrochlorothiazide,Bisphosphonate,Spironolactone,3,"Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, zoledronic acid) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and are used in osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, and metastatic bone disease. A serious adverse effect is osteonecrosis of the jaw, particularly after invasive dental procedures, due to impaired bone remodeling and healing. Loop diuretics such as furosemide and thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide are mainly associated with electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia with loops; hypercalcemia with thiazides) rather than jaw necrosis. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist, may cause gynecomastia and hyperkalemia. High-yield: Bisphosphonates are linked to osteonecrosis of the jaw; thiazides increase calcium levels; loops decrease calcium levels and can be ototoxic.",9,,
Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of sulfonamide antibiotics?,Inhibit cell wall synthesis,Inhibit folic acid synthesis by competing with p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA),Inhibit DNA gyrase,Block 50S ribosomal subunit,2,"Sulfonamide antibiotics are structural analogs of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and act as competitive inhibitors of dihydropteroate synthase, an enzyme required for folic acid synthesis in bacteria. By blocking folate production, they prevent synthesis of nucleotides necessary for DNA replication. Human cells are unaffected because they cannot synthesize folic acid and must obtain it from the diet. Sulfonamides are active against a broad spectrum of bacteria, with clinical applications in treating urinary tract infections, Nocardia infections, Actinomyces, and in some cases Chlamydia. Resistance occurs via altered enzyme affinity, increased PABA production, or impaired drug uptake. 👉 High-yield review: Mechanism: Inhibit folic acid synthesis (dihydropteroate synthase, PABA analogs). Key uses: UTIs, Nocardia, Actinomyces, Chlamydia. Side effects: Hypersensitivity reactions, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, hemolysis in G6PD deficiency, kernicterus in infants. Synergy: Often combined with trimethoprim (TMP-SMX) → sequential blockade of folate pathway.",9,,
Which of the following local anesthetics is metabolized primarily in the blood by pseudocholinesterase?,Lidocaine,Prilocaine,Benzocaine,Procaine,4,"<b>Amide vs. Ester Local Anesthetics</b><br><br>
Ester local anesthetics (e.g., procaine, benzocaine, tetracaine) are metabolized in the <b>plasma by pseudocholinesterase</b> into para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) derivatives. 
This rapid metabolism contributes to their <b>shorter duration of action</b> and higher potential for allergic reactions (due to PABA).<br><br>
Amide local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, bupivacaine, prilocaine, mepivacaine) are metabolized <b>in the liver via microsomal enzymes (CYP450 system)</b> and have <b>longer duration of action</b>.<br><br>
<b>High-Yield Recap:</b><br>
- <b>Esters</b> → Blood metabolism (pseudocholinesterase)<br>
- <b>Amides</b> → Hepatic metabolism (CYP450)<br>

Which of the following local anesthetics is most likely to cause methemoglobinemia when administered in high doses?,Lidocaine,Prilocaine,Bupivacaine,Mepivacaine,2,"<b>Methemoglobinemia and Local Anesthetics</b><br><br>
Methemoglobinemia occurs when hemoglobin’s iron (Fe²⁺) is oxidized to ferric form (Fe³⁺), forming methemoglobin which cannot carry oxygen. 
This leads to <b>functional hypoxia</b> despite normal PaO₂.<br><br>
<b>Prilocaine</b> and <b>benzocaine</b> are most commonly implicated. Prilocaine’s metabolite, <b>o-toluidine</b>, is a strong oxidizing agent. 
Patients may present with <b>cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen</b> and <b>chocolate-colored blood</b>.<br><br>

Which of the following best explains why local anesthetics are less effective in infected or inflamed tissues?,"The infection increases tissue perfusion, diluting the anesthetic","The infection raises tissue pH, increasing drug ionization","The infection lowers tissue pH, reducing the proportion of uncharged drug","The infection increases pseudocholinesterase activity, degrading the drug faster",3,"<b>Effect of Tissue pH on Local Anesthetic Efficacy</b><br><br>
Local anesthetics (LAs) are <b>weak bases</b> that exist in both uncharged (lipid-soluble) and charged (water-soluble) forms. 
The <b>uncharged form (B)</b> crosses nerve membranes, while the <b>charged form (BH⁺)</b> binds sodium channels.<br><br>
In <b>acidic tissue (infection)</b>, the equilibrium shifts toward the ionized BH⁺ form, which cannot cross lipid membranes — leading to <b>poor anesthetic penetration</b> and reduced efficacy.<br><br>
<b>Clinical Implications:</b><br>
- Infected tissues (low pH) = poor anesthesia<br>
- Use nerve blocks distant from infection site<br>
- Buffering anesthetics with bicarbonate can improve onset<br><br>

What is the mechanism of action of lidocaine?,Inhibition of calcium influx at presynaptic terminals,Competitive blockade of acetylcholine receptors,Blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels in the neuronal membrane,Enhancement of potassium efflux to hyperpolarize the membrane,3,"<b>Mechanism of Action of Lidocaine</b><br><br>
Lidocaine is an <b>amide-type local anesthetic</b> that works by <b>blocking voltage-gated sodium channels</b> on the intracellular side of neuronal membranes. 
This prevents sodium influx, halting depolarization and propagation of nerve impulses.<br><br>
<b>State-dependent blockade:</b> It binds more effectively to open or inactivated channels, making it more selective for active (pain) fibers.<br><br>
<b>Functional Loss Order:</b> Pain → Temperature → Touch → Motor<br>
Small unmyelinated C fibers are most sensitive.<br><br>
<b>Key Facts:</b><br>
- Rapid onset (pKa ≈ 7.9)<br>
- Duration: 60–120 min (longer with epinephrine)<br>
- Metabolism: Hepatic (CYP450)<br>
- Toxicity: CNS stimulation → seizures → depression; high doses → cardiac depression<br><br>

Which of the following local anesthetics has intrinsic vasoconstrictive properties?,Lidocaine,Prilocaine,Cocaine,Articaine,3,"Cocaine is the only local anesthetic that has intrinsic vasoconstrictive properties. It achieves this by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine at sympathetic nerve endings, leading to prolonged stimulation of α-adrenergic receptors and subsequent vasoconstriction.<br><br>
This property distinguishes it from all other local anesthetics, which typically cause vasodilation and are therefore combined with a vasoconstrictor like epinephrine to prolong duration and reduce bleeding.<br><br>
<b>High-Yield Recap:</b><ul>
<li><b>Cocaine:</b> Vasoconstrictor (inhibits norepinephrine reuptake).</li>
<li><b>All others:</b> Vasodilators (require epinephrine for vasoconstriction).</li>

<b>1. Interaction with Antiplatelet Drugs (e.g., Clopidogrel, Aspirin):</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Some β-lactams (especially penicillins and cephalosporins) can <b>diminish the effect of antiplatelet agents</b> by interfering with <b>platelet aggregation</b> or competing at platelet receptor sites.</li>
<li>Penicillins reversibly inhibit platelet aggregation through blockade of ADP-induced platelet activation and reduce platelet adhesion.</li>
<li>However, the overall <b>antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel</b> may appear <b>diminished</b> in patients taking β-lactams concurrently, particularly at high antibiotic doses.</li>
