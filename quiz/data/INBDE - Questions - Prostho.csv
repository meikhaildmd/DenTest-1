<li><b>Titanium:</b> Biocompatible, but difficult to cast.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>High-Yield Summary:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Material of choice:</b> Base metal alloys (usually Co–Cr).</li>

"In a Kennedy Class I removable partial denture, what is the main function of the rests placed on canines or premolars anterior to the edentulous areas?",To provide vertical support to the denture base,To act as indirect retainers that prevent lifting of the distal extension base,To locate the axis of rotation (fulcrum line),To provide direct retention against horizontal dislodgment,2,"<b>Indirect Retainers and the Fulcrum Line in Distal Extension RPDs</b><br><br>
<b>Overview:</b><br>
In distal extension RPDs (Kennedy Class I and II), the base tends to rotate around a <b>fulcrum line</b> through the posterior rests.  
<b>Indirect retainers</b>—usually anterior rests—resist this lifting movement.<br><br>
<b>Key Concepts:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Fulcrum line:</b> Passes through terminal abutment rests.</li>
<li><b>Indirect retainers:</b> Placed anterior and perpendicular to that line (e.g., on canines or premolars).</li>
<li><b>Function:</b> Prevent lifting of the distal extension base (tissue-ward rotation).</li>
<li><b>All rests</b> provide vertical support; <b>indirect retainers</b> specifically prevent rotation.</li>

What is the primary purpose of rest seats in a removable partial denture (RPD)?,Support,Stability,Retention,Aesthetics,1,"<b>Purpose of Rest Seats in Removable Partial Dentures</b><br><br>
<b>Overview:</b><br>
A <b>rest seat</b> is prepared on an abutment tooth to receive the rest component of an RPD.  
Its primary role is <b>vertical support</b>, directing occlusal forces along the long axis of the tooth.<br><br>
<b>Key Points:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Prevents denture from moving tissue-ward under load.</li>
<li>Transfers forces to abutment teeth for stability.</li>
<li>Maintains occlusal relationships and prevents tissue impingement.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Support vs. Other Functions:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Support:</b> Rests and rest seats.</li>
<li><b>Stability:</b> Guide planes and rigid connectors.</li>
<li><b>Retention:</b> Clasps engaging undercuts.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>High-Yield Summary:</b><br>
<ul>

What is the most common cause of a gag reflex in a patient wearing new complete dentures?,Improper centric relation,Overextended posterior border of the maxillary denture,Excessive occlusal vertical dimension,Underextended lingual flange of the mandibular denture,2,"<b>Gag Reflex in Denture Patients</b><br><br>
A gag reflex commonly occurs when the posterior border of a maxillary denture extends too far back, contacting the <b>soft palate</b> beyond the <b>vibrating line</b>.  
This overstimulation of the movable soft palate triggers a reflexive gagging response.<br><br>
<b>Key Concept:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>The <b>vibrating line</b> marks the junction of the hard and soft palate.</li>
<li>The denture should terminate <b>just anterior to this line</b> to achieve a proper seal without touching movable tissue.</li>
<li>Extension too far posteriorly → <b>gagging and discomfort</b>.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Other Common Denture Complications:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Sore throat:</b> Mandibular overextension distally.</li>
<li><b>Loss of retention:</b> Underextended borders or inadequate seal.</li>
<li><b>Soreness of ridge:</b> Overpressure or poor tissue adaptation.</li>
<li><b>Speech difficulty:</b> Over-thick palatal area or improper tooth position.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>High-Yield Summary:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Main cause of gagging:</b> Overextended posterior border beyond vibrating line.</li>
<li><b>Fix:</b> Shorten border to stop at vibrating line.</li>
<li><b>Location:</b> Between hard and soft palate junction.</li>

"A patient was recently given complete dentures for both jaws. Within a few days, she complained of cheek biting. What is the most likely reason?",Increased vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO),Decreased vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO),Excessive horizontal overlap (overjet),Posterior teeth set too far lingually,2,"<b>Cheek Biting in Complete Denture Patients</b><br><br>
Cheek biting occurs most often due to a <b>decrease in vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO)</b> or improper tooth positioning.<br><br>
<b>Mechanism:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>When VDO is reduced, the <b>buccal mucosa folds inward</b>, allowing it to get caught between teeth.</li>
<li>Posterior teeth placed too far buccally also increase soft tissue interference.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Management:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Re-establish proper <b>VDO</b>.</li>
<li>Recontour buccal surfaces to guide cheeks away.</li>
<li>Check occlusal contacts and harmony.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>High-Yield Summary:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Main cause:</b> Decreased VDO or buccal tooth placement.</li>

A patient with a complete mandibular denture complains of a localized burning sensation in the lower ridge region. What is the most likely cause?,Pressure on the mental foramen,Fungal infection (Candida albicans),Excessive occlusal vertical dimension,Poor saliva flow causing mucosal irritation,1,"<b>Localized Burning Sensation Under Mandibular Denture</b><br><br>
A <b>burning or sharp pain</b localized in the mandibular premolar region usually results from <b>pressure on the mental foramen</b> caused by ridge resorption.<br><br>
<b>Mechanism:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>As the ridge resorbs, the <b>mental nerve</b> becomes superficial.</li>
<li>The denture base compresses the nerve, producing <b>burning or tingling pain</b>.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Management:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Relieve pressure in the foramen area.</li>
<li>Rebase or reline denture for better adaptation.</li>
<li>Consider <b>implant-supported overdenture</b> for severe resorption.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>High-Yield Summary:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Most likely cause:</b> Pressure on the mental foramen.</li>
<li><b>Common in:</b> Severely resorbed ridges.</li>

Which statement about a cantilever bridge is most accurate?,It distributes occlusal forces evenly across multiple abutments,It is supported by abutment teeth only on one side of the edentulous space,It has better stress distribution than a conventional fixed partial denture,It is primarily indicated for replacement of posterior molars,2,"<b>Cantilever Bridge – Overview</b><br><br>
A <b>cantilever bridge</b> replaces a missing tooth but is <b>supported only on one side</b> of the edentulous space.  
It acts like a lever, concentrating stress on the abutment tooth.<br><br>
<b>Biomechanics:</b><br>
<ul>

</ul><br>
<b>Clinical Use:</b><br>
<ul>
