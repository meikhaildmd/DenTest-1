A 6-year-10-month-old presents with a tender swelling in the buccal vestibule adjacent to #K. A periapical radiograph shows a furcation radiolucency and pathologic root resorption of the primary molar. The crown is restorable. What is the most appropriate treatment?,Pulpotomy,Pulpectomy,Extraction,Observation,3,"In primary molars, the presence of a furcation radiolucency indicates pulp necrosis with spread of infection into the interradicular bone. Pathologic root resorption is a definitive indication for extraction, as the tooth cannot be maintained predictably. Both findings together confirm extraction as the correct treatment.

Pulpotomy — Indicated for vital teeth with carious or traumatic (>24h) pulp exposure, minimal symptoms, and no signs of furcation or periapical pathology. Contraindicated here due to necrosis, furcation radiolucency, and root resorption.

Pulpectomy — Indicated for necrotic teeth only if roots are intact, canals are negotiable, the tooth is restorable, and the child is cooperative. Contraindicated here because of root resorption and furcation involvement.

Extraction — Indicated when there is pathologic root resorption, furcation involvement, unrestorable crown, or poor prognosis. This case meets multiple criteria, making extraction the best treatment.

Observation — Only considered when there are no signs of necrosis or pathology. Not appropriate here due to swelling, furcation involvement, and resorption.

High-Yield Points:
- Root resorption in a primary molar = extraction (absolute). 
- Furcation radiolucency is a contraindication to pulp therapy and strongly supports extraction.
- Pulpotomy requires vital radicular pulp and no pathology. 
- Pulpectomy requires necrotic pulp with intact roots and a cooperative child.",2,,
Which of the following conditions is least likely to be associated with premature exfoliation of primary teeth?,Chediak–Higashi disease,von Willebrand disease,Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome,Hypophosphatasia,2,"Premature exfoliation of primary teeth is linked to systemic and metabolic disorders that affect periodontal support, bone, or immune function.
        •        Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome — Autosomal recessive disorder characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma and aggressive periodontitis. Severe periodontal breakdown causes premature tooth loss. ✅ Associated.
        •        Hypophosphatasia — Metabolic bone disorder caused by low alkaline phosphatase activity. Leads to defective cementum and early exfoliation of teeth, often before caries or periodontal breakdown. ✅ Associated.
        •        Langerhans cell histiocytosis — Proliferation of Langerhans cells causes bony lesions, “floating teeth” appearance on radiographs, and premature exfoliation. ✅ Associated.
        •        Chediak–Higashi syndrome — Rare immunodeficiency with impaired neutrophil function. Severe periodontitis and early tooth loss are common features. ✅ Associated.
        •        von Willebrand disease — A bleeding disorder caused by deficiency/dysfunction of von Willebrand factor. It leads to mucosal bleeding and easy bruising but does not affect periodontal support or cementum, so it is not associated with premature exfoliation. ❌

High-Yield Points
        •        Premature exfoliation of primary teeth = think systemic disorders affecting bone, cementum, or immunity.
        •        Big four associations:
        1.        Papillon–Lefèvre (periodontal destruction)
        2.        Hypophosphatasia (defective cementum/bone)
        3.        Langerhans cell histiocytosis (bony lesions, “floating teeth”)
        4.        Chediak–Higashi (immunodeficiency → severe periodontitis)
        •        Bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand disease) cause hemorrhage, not tooth loss.

✅ Correct answer: von Willebrand disease.",2,,
"A 5-year-old is seen for follow-up 3 weeks after a playground accident involving the maxillary primary central incisors. Both teeth now appear darkly discolored, but the child has no pain. Clinical exam shows no swelling or sinus tract, and periapical radiographs are normal. What is the most appropriate management?",Extraction,Pulpotomy,Observation with follow-up,Pulpectomy and restoration,3,"Post-traumatic discoloration of primary incisors within the first few weeks is usually due to pulpal hemorrhage with diffusion of blood pigments into dentin. These teeth are often asymptomatic and may remain discolored until normal exfoliation. In the absence of pain, swelling, sinus tract, or radiographic pathology, the correct management is observation with periodic reevaluation.

- Extraction — Indicated if there are later signs of necrosis, swelling, sinus tract, or radiographic evidence of pathologic root resorption. Given the child’s age (5 years) and the expected exfoliation of incisors at 6–7 years, extraction would be the treatment of choice if pathology develops.
- Pulpotomy — For vital pulp exposures without radicular pathology. Not appropriate here because there is no pulp exposure and no pathology.
- Pulpectomy and restoration — For necrotic teeth with intact roots that require long-term retention. Not relevant for a near-exfoliation incisor.
- Observation — Correct. No treatment is required other than recall monitoring until natural exfoliation or unless signs of necrosis appear.

High-yield points:
- Early discoloration in primary teeth after trauma is often due to hemorrhage, not necrosis.
- Unlike permanent teeth, discoloration in primary teeth is not always pathologic.
- If pathology develops close to exfoliation age, the treatment is extraction.

Correct answer: Observation with follow-up.",2,,
"A 4-year-old child presents for their first dental visit. The dentist explains to the child what will happen, shows the instruments, and then proceeds with the procedure exactly as described. This technique is an example of:",Distraction,Modeling,Tell–Show–Do,Voice control,3,"Tell–Show–Do (TSD) is the most fundamental behavior guidance technique in pediatric dentistry. 
It reduces anxiety, establishes trust, and desensitizes the child to procedures.

- Tell — Explain procedure in simple, age-appropriate terms.
- Show — Demonstrate on a model, finger, or instrument (visual and auditory desensitization).
- Do — Perform the procedure exactly as explained.

Why others are incorrect:
- Distraction — Uses external stimuli (TV, conversation) to divert attention. Not TSD.
- Modeling — Child observes another cooperative patient. Helpful but different concept.
- Voice control — Altering tone/volume to manage compliance. More directive, not explanatory.

High-yield points:
- TSD is universally applicable, safe, and highly effective in most children.
- Forms the foundation before more advanced techniques (positive reinforcement, distraction, modeling, voice control).
- Considered a standard of care in pediatric dentistry (AAPD guideline).

Correct answer: Tell–Show–Do.",2,,

"These are small keratizing cysts arising in epithelial remnants trapped along lines of fusion of embryological processes, which appear in the midline of the hard palate in newborn infants. This definition refers to:",Epstein’s pearls,Bohn’s nodules,Congenital epulis,White sponge nevus,1,"Epstein’s pearls are keratin-filled cysts at the palatal midline (fusion line), common in neonates (~60–80%). Management: benign, asymptomatic, resolve spontaneously within weeks, no treatment required. Bohn’s nodules are salivary gland-derived cysts found on alveolar ridges; also self-limiting and require no treatment. Congenital epulis is a benign granular cell tumor of the gingiva, usually anterior maxilla; surgical excision if obstructive, otherwise may regress. White sponge nevus is a hereditary keratinization disorder presenting as diffuse, white spongy plaques in childhood/adolescence; benign, no treatment required.",2,,
A 9-year-old presents with an unusually large anterior tooth. Radiographs show two separate root canals within the crown. Counting the teeth in the arch reveals one tooth fewer than expected. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Fusion,Gemination,Concrescence,Dens invaginatus,1,"Fusion is the union of two adjacent tooth germs, often producing a large tooth with two pulp chambers or canals. The key diagnostic clue is a reduced tooth count in the arch. Gemination is an incomplete division of a single tooth bud, producing a bifid crown but with a normal total tooth count. Concrescence involves union by cementum only, usually in posterior maxillary teeth and often asymptomatic. Dens invaginatus results from enamel infolding ('dens in dente'), predisposing to caries and pulpitis. Management: Esthetic reshaping or endodontic therapy may be indicated if pulp systems are involved.",2,,
A clinician performing a pulpectomy on a primary molar notes that the canals are difficult to instrument and fill compared with permanent molars. Which anatomical features of primary teeth explain this challenge?,Shorter roots with fewer canals,More flared roots with numerous accessory canals,Thicker dentin with smaller pulp chambers,Enamel rods in the cervical third extending gingivally,2,"Primary molar roots are longer, thinner, and more flared to accommodate the developing permanent tooth bud. They also contain more accessory canals, especially in the furcation area, which complicates instrumentation, irrigation, and obturation during pulpectomy. Other relevant differences include larger pulp chambers with pulp horns closer to the surface, making pulp exposure more likely, and accessory canals in the furcation that allow infection to spread quickly. Additional differences: thinner enamel and dentin, crowns with more pronounced cervical constrictions and narrower occlusal tables, whiter shade, and cervical enamel rods extending occlusally. Clinical implications: pulpectomy is technically difficult and less reliable, so pulpotomy or extraction with space maintenance may be preferred. Restorative preps must be conservative, and multi-surface lesions are often treated with stainless steel crowns.",2,,
Statement 1: Primary teeth are less mineralized and therefore appear whiter in shade. Statement 2: Primary molars have broader occlusal tables and thicker enamel compared to permanent molars. Which of the following is correct?,Both statements are true,Both statements are false,Statement 1 is true; Statement 2 is false,Statement 1 is false; Statement 2 is true,3,"Statement 1 is true: Primary teeth are less mineralized, which makes them appear whiter and more opaque than permanent teeth. This difference has restorative implications for shade matching in esthetic restorations. Statement 2 is false: Primary molars actually have narrower occlusal tables and thinner enamel, not broader and thicker. Other differences include more pronounced cervical constrictions, broader and flatter contacts, and dentinal tubules that are larger and less mineralized, allowing faster caries progression. Pulp chambers are proportionally larger with pulp horns closer to the surface. Clinical implications: caries progress more quickly, class II restorations are more challenging, stainless steel crowns are often the treatment of choice, and shade selection differs due to whiter enamel.",2,,
A 7-year-old presents with a mandibular second primary molar that has undergone a pulpotomy. The tooth has large proximal lesions and the parent reports the child has a high caries risk. Which of the following is the most appropriate restoration for this tooth?,Amalgam filling,Composite resin filling,Stainless steel crown,Extraction and band-and-loop space maintainer,3,"In primary molars that have received pulp therapy, the most reliable restoration is a stainless steel crown. Multi-surface fillings with amalgam or composite may be used for smaller lesions, but they are prone to recurrent decay, marginal breakdown, or fracture in teeth already weakened by both caries and pulpotomy access. A stainless steel crown provides full coverage, protects the remaining tooth structure, and prevents new caries. It is durable under occlusal forces, relatively easy to place, and cost-effective compared to multiple surface restorations. In high-caries-risk children, SSCs are especially valuable because they reduce the chance of needing retreatment. Extraction with a space maintainer would only be indicated if the tooth was non-restorable or had poor prognosis. In this case, the tooth is vital, restorable, and should be maintained in the arch. Preserving the tooth maintains chewing function and helps hold space for the eruption of the permanent successor. For these reasons, the stainless steel crown is the treatment of choice.",2,,
Which of the following best describes the sequence of events leading to enamel and dentin formation during odontogenesis?,"Odontoblasts differentiate first, then induce preameloblasts; dentin forms before enamel","Inner enamel epithelium differentiates into preameloblasts, which induce preodontoblasts; odontoblasts lay dentin first, then ameloblasts form enamel","Ameloblasts differentiate first, inducing odontoblasts; enamel forms before dentin",Ameloblasts and odontoblasts differentiate simultaneously; enamel and dentin form together,2,"During the bell stage, cells of the inner enamel epithelium elongate into preameloblasts, which signal adjacent mesenchymal cells of the dental papilla to differentiate into preodontoblasts. These mature into odontoblasts and secrete predentin first, which then induces the preameloblasts to become functional ameloblasts and begin secreting enamel. This process of reciprocal induction ensures that dentin always forms before enamel, and enamel cannot form without dentin as a template. The earliest mineralization occurs at the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) around 4-6 months in utero. From this point, enamel formation progresses outward toward the crown surface, while dentin formation progresses inward toward the pulp. Clinically, this sequence explains why defects in dentinogenesis often secondarily produce enamel hypoplasia, while enamel defects alone (such as amelogenesis imperfecta) reflect disruption at the level of the enamel organ. Following apposition, root formation begins under Hertwig's epithelial root sheath, while the dental follicle differentiates into cementum, alveolar bone, and the periodontal ligament.",2,,
A 9-year-old presents with a maxillary lateral incisor showing a deep lingual pit and radiographic evidence of an invagination of enamel into the pulp. This developmental anomaly most likely originated during which stage of odontogenesis?,Initiation stage,Bud stage,Cap stage,Mineralization stage,3,"The cap stage (around week 9 in utero) is when the tooth germ organizes into three distinct components: the enamel organ (enamel), dental papilla (dentin and pulp), and dental follicle (cementum, bone, PDL). Within the enamel organ, the enamel knot acts as a signaling center that helps establish cusp patterning. Because this stage determines tooth morphology, defects here lead to anomalies such as dens invaginatus (dens-in-dente), fusion, gemination, and accessory cusps. Clinically, dens invaginatus predisposes to early caries and pulpal involvement because the invaginated enamel is thin and plaque-retentive.",2,,
Which of the following correctly matches the epithelial remnants of odontogenesis with their stage of origin?,Epithelial rests of Serres from Hertwig's root sheath,Epithelial rests of Malassez from disintegration of the dental lamina,Epithelial rests of Serres from disintegration of the dental lamina,Nasmyth's membrane from the enamel organ during the cap stage,3,"The dental lamina degenerates after initiation, leaving behind epithelial rests of Serres, which may persist in the gingiva and contribute to eruption cysts. During root formation, disintegration of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) leaves behind the epithelial rests of Malassez, found in the periodontal ligament and associated with radicular cysts. Nasmyth's membrane (primary enamel cuticle) is produced by the reduced enamel epithelium after enamel formation and coats newly erupted teeth. These remnants explain the developmental basis of many odontogenic cysts.",2,,
Which of the following correctly describes the role of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) during odontogenesis?,Guides cusp patterning during cap stage,Shapes root morphology and induces radicular dentin formation,Gives rise directly to cementoblasts and PDL fibroblasts,Differentiates into odontoblasts that secrete dentin,2,"After crown formation, the cervical loop of the enamel organ proliferates apically to form Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS). HERS defines the shape, length, and number of roots, and induces adjacent papilla cells to differentiate into odontoblasts, which deposit radicular dentin. As dentin is laid down, HERS fragments, leaving the epithelial rests of Malassez in the periodontal ligament, which may later seed periapical cysts. HERS does not directly form cementum or PDL; instead, these tissues come from ectomesenchymal cells of the dental follicle. Abnormalities in HERS can lead to short roots, dilacerations, or accessory root canals.",2,,
A 4-year-old presents after avulsion of a maxillary primary central incisor. What is the recommended management regarding reimplantation?,Reimplant immediately and place a flexible splint for 1–2 weeks,"Do not reimplant; control bleeding, provide analgesia, soft diet, and arrange follow-up",Soak the tooth in doxycycline and reimplant,Reimplant only if extraoral dry time is under 60 minutes,2,"Primary teeth should not be reimplanted because manipulation can injure the developing permanent successor and increase the risks of ankylosis, infection, and aspiration. Management is conservative: confirm the tooth is not intruded or associated with alveolar fracture, control bleeding, provide analgesics, review tetanus status, maintain oral hygiene (e.g., chlorhexidine if age-appropriate), advise a soft diet, and schedule clinical/radiographic follow-up. Space maintenance is usually unnecessary for lost primary incisors. This differs from permanent tooth avulsion, where immediate reimplantation is recommended when feasible.",2,,
Which finding best distinguishes subluxation from concussion of a tooth?,Subluxation shows mobility without displacement,Concussion presents with mobility but no displacement,Subluxation always involves displacement,There is no difference,1,"Dental trauma often affects the periodontal ligament (PDL), and correct diagnosis guides treatment. Concussion = injury to the PDL without mobility or displacement (tooth is tender to percussion but stable). Subluxation = mobility present but no displacement. Both are minor luxation injuries. Management is conservative: soft diet, oral hygiene, possible chlorhexidine rinses, and follow-up to monitor pulp vitality. Distinguishing between the two prevents overtreatment.",2,,
A 5-year-old presents with an intruded primary maxillary central incisor. What is the appropriate management?,Reposition and splint for 2 weeks,Observe for spontaneous re-eruption or natural exfoliation,Extract the tooth immediately,Rigid splint for 4–6 weeks,2,Intrusion is the most common traumatic injury in upper primary incisors. The pliable alveolar bone in children allows the tooth to be driven apically into the socket rather than fracturing. Management is conservative: most intruded primary teeth spontaneously re-erupt. Intervention is required only if the crown is displaced toward the permanent successor bud or if there is aspiration risk. Splinting is contraindicated. Radiographic follow-up is essential because intrusive trauma may cause enamel defects or malformations of permanent successors.,2,,
A 9-year-old presents with an extrusively luxated permanent maxillary incisor. What is the recommended splinting approach?,Rigid splint for 4–6 weeks,Flexible splint for 10–14 days,"No splinting, observe only",Flexible splint for 3 months,2,"Extrusive luxation is a partial displacement of the tooth out of the socket. Clinically, the tooth appears elongated and is mobile with gingival bleeding. Management: gently reposition the tooth into the socket and stabilize with a flexible splint for 10–14 days. Flexibility allows physiologic movement and reduces ankylosis risk. Compare: lateral luxation and alveolar fracture require rigid splinting for 4–6 weeks; root fractures need up to 3 months of flexible splinting. Supportive care includes analgesics, a soft diet, good oral hygiene, and pulp vitality monitoring.",2,,
"In a case of alveolar fracture involving displacement of multiple anterior teeth, what is the recommended splinting protocol?",Flexible splint for 7–10 days,Rigid splint for 4–6 weeks,Flexible splint for 3 months,No splinting; allow spontaneous healing,2,"Alveolar fractures involve teeth and supporting alveolar bone. Because bone segments are unstable, a rigid splint is required for stability. The recommended period is 4–6 weeks to allow osseous healing. Flexible splints are insufficient for bone fractures. Management also includes repositioning of the segment, antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis when indicated, and radiographic follow-up.",2,,
A 10-year-old boy avulses a maxillary permanent central incisor on the playground. What is the recommended management if the tooth is brought in within 30 minutes in milk?,Discard the tooth; prognosis is hopeless,Replant immediately with finger pressure and splint flexibly for 14 days,Delay replantation and perform root canal treatment first,Store the tooth in water for 24 hours before replanting,2,"Avulsed permanent teeth should be replanted as soon as possible. Even when long-term survival is uncertain, replantation maintains alveolar bone and occlusion. First aid: handle the tooth by the crown, rinse briefly if dirty (preferably milk, saline, or saliva), and replant immediately if possible. In the dental office: irrigate the socket, replant gently, and apply a flexible splint for about 14 days. Splint longer if there is an alveolar fracture (4–6 weeks) or a root fracture (3 months). Endodontics: immature apices may revascularize; mature or closed apices usually need root canal treatment soon after replantation to prevent resorption. Time is critical: prognosis declines sharply after 60 minutes dry.",2,,
Which of the following is the most appropriate transport medium for an avulsed permanent tooth if immediate replantation is not possible?,Water,Milk,Hydrogen peroxide solution,Dry napkin,2,The prognosis of a replanted tooth depends on periodontal ligament cell viability. Milk is the best readily available storage medium because it is isotonic with a compatible pH and preserves cell viability. Acceptable alternatives include saline or the patient’s saliva when milk is not available. Water is harmful because it is hypotonic and causes rapid lysis of ligament cells. Antiseptics such as hydrogen peroxide are cytotoxic and must not be used. The ideal strategy remains immediate replantation when feasible.,2,,
"In a subcondylar mandibular fracture, the condylar head is most commonly displaced in which direction?",Posteriorly,Anteromedially,Laterally,Superiorly,2,"The lateral pterygoid muscle inserts on the condylar head and neck. After a subcondylar fracture, this muscle pulls the condylar fragment anteromedially. This displacement pattern is a classic diagnostic clue on imaging, including the reverse Towne’s view. In children, condylar fractures matter because the condyle is a mandibular growth center; mismanagement risks ankylosis, asymmetry, and growth disturbances. Treatment may be conservative or surgical depending on displacement and function.",2,,
Which region is most commonly involved in mandibular fractures in children?,Condylar region,Angle,Parasymphysial region,Coronoid process,3,"In children, the parasymphysial region (area adjacent to the mandibular symphysis, usually between the canines) is the most frequent site of mandibular fractures. This reflects anatomy and behavior: the mandible narrows anteriorly (reduced cross-sectional strength), developing bone is less mineralized, and chin-first falls/play injuries are common. The condyle is typically the second most common site, followed by the angle; coronoid fractures are rare. Pediatric management trends conservative to preserve growth, with fixation reserved for displaced/unstable patterns.",2,,
A patient sustains a blow to the left body of the mandible during a sporting accident. Radiographic evaluation is most likely to reveal a fracture at which site?,Ipsilateral angle of the mandible,Contralateral condylar neck,Ipsilateral coronoid process,Contralateral symphysis,2,"The condylar neck is a structurally weak point and commonly fractures from indirect force transmission. A blow to one side of the mandible (e.g., left body/angle) often produces a fracture at the contralateral condylar neck. Ipsilateral angle fractures may occur if the area is weakened (e.g., impacted third molar), but in the classic indirect-force scenario the opposite condyle is more vulnerable. Clinical signs include deviation toward the affected side, limited opening, preauricular pain, and malocclusion; pediatric cases need careful follow-up to avoid growth disturbances.",2,,
Which of the following conditions is NOT typically associated with premature exfoliation of primary teeth?,Hypophosphatasia,Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome,Langerhans cell histiocytosis,Hypophosphatemic rickets,4,"Premature exfoliation of primary teeth is associated with systemic conditions that weaken bone or periodontal attachment. Hypophosphatasia causes defective cementum and early tooth loss without root resorption. Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome causes aggressive periodontitis and rapid tooth loss. Langerhans cell histiocytosis produces bony destruction with 'floating teeth.' Chediak–Higashi disease involves immunodeficiency with severe periodontitis. Hypophosphatemic rickets, however, causes enamel and dentin defects but does not typically lead to premature tooth loss.",2,,
"A child presents with multiple unerupted permanent teeth, numerous supernumerary teeth, and hypoplastic or absent clavicles. Which syndrome best explains these findings?",Down syndrome,Cleidocranial dysplasia,Crouzon syndrome,Treacher Collins syndrome,2,"Cleidocranial dysplasia is a skeletal disorder marked by hypoplastic or absent clavicles, delayed eruption, and numerous supernumerary teeth. Persistent primary teeth and failure of permanent eruption are typical. Skull anomalies include open sutures and wormian bones. It is high-yield for ADAT due to integration of skeletal and dental features.",2,,
Crouzon syndrome is caused by premature closure of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis). Which of the following oral findings is most characteristic?,Midface hypoplasia with crowding and high-arched palate,Hypoplastic clavicles with multiple supernumerary teeth,Macroglossia with periodontal disease,Peg-shaped lateral incisors and taurodontism,1,"Crouzon syndrome (craniofacial dysostosis) results from FGFR2 mutations that cause premature suture fusion. Oral manifestations include midface hypoplasia, high-arched or cleft palate, and dental crowding. It is differentiated from cleidocranial dysplasia (clavicular defects and supernumerary teeth) and Down syndrome (macroglossia and periodontal disease).",2,,
"A 5-year-old child presents with fever, sore throat, and multiple small vesicular-ulcerative lesions on the soft palate and tonsillar pillars. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Herpetic gingivostomatitis,Hand-foot-and-mouth disease,Herpangina,Candidiasis,3,"Herpangina is an acute viral infection of childhood most often caused by Coxsackie A viruses. It has a sudden onset with fever, sore throat, and malaise, followed by small vesicles that rupture to form shallow ulcers. These lesions characteristically occur on the posterior oral cavity—soft palate, uvula, and tonsillar pillars. The condition is self-limiting and resolves within about a week. This posterior localization helps distinguish herpangina from herpetic gingivostomatitis (anterior gingiva and mucosa), hand-foot-and-mouth disease (oral plus skin lesions), and candidiasis (white plaques that wipe away).",2,,
Which of the following is a contraindication to the use of nitrous oxide–oxygen inhalation sedation in children?,Asthma,An uncooperative child,Mild anxiety related to dental treatment,Strong gag reflex during dental procedures,2,"Nitrous oxide is a safe and effective agent for anxiolysis and mild sedation in pediatric dentistry. It is well tolerated and even considered safe in children with asthma, since it is non-irritating to the airway. The main contraindications are situations where the technique cannot be performed effectively, such as in an uncooperative child who cannot calmly accept or breathe through the nasal hood. Other contraindications include acute upper respiratory infections, nasal obstruction, recent ear or eye surgery involving gas spaces, severe chronic pulmonary disease, and certain psychiatric or communication disorders. Thus, cooperation of the child is essential for nitrous oxide sedation to be feasible.",2,,
"In pediatric dentistry, the behavioral technique known as 'modeling' is best described as:",Using fun labels and suggesting use of imagination,Ignoring a behavior and redirecting attention elsewhere,Providing an example or demonstration of how to perform a desired behavior,"Informing, demonstrating, and then guiding the child through a procedure",3,"Modeling is a behavior management technique in which a child learns by observing another person, often a peer, sibling, or the dentist, successfully completing a procedure or demonstrating cooperative behavior. Children are more likely to adopt a behavior when they see someone similar to themselves performing it calmly and without fear. This technique reduces anxiety by normalizing the experience and showing that the procedure can be completed safely. Modeling is distinct from the tell-show-do technique, which involves directly instructing and demonstrating to the same child.",2,,
"A 5-year-old boy presents with pain in a mandibular first primary molar for two days. Clinical exam shows a large carious lesion with pulp exposure, but surrounding tissues appear normal. A radiograph shows caries extending into the pulp with no periapical or furcal pathology. What is the most appropriate treatment?",Calcium hydroxide pulpotomy,Pulpectomy,Formocresol pulpotomy,Direct pulp capping with calcium hydroxide or zinc oxide cement,3,"In a primary molar with carious pulp exposure but no signs of radicular pulp involvement or periapical pathology, the treatment of choice is pulpotomy. The coronal pulp is removed and the radicular pulp preserved. Formocresol has historically been the standard medicament, though ferric sulfate and MTA are modern alternatives. Direct pulp capping is not recommended in primary teeth due to poor long-term success and risk of internal resorption. Pulpectomy is indicated if radicular pulp involvement is evident, and extraction is reserved for non-restorable or severely infected teeth.",2,,
Which of the following radiographic findings is most indicative of successful healing after partial pulpotomy in an immature permanent tooth?,Irregular pulp canal calcification,Periodontal ligament widening or periradicular radiolucency,Formation of a dentinal bridge between the pulp wound and capping material,Pulp canal obliteration (PCO),3,"The goal of partial pulpotomy in immature permanent teeth (apexogenesis) is to preserve pulp vitality so that root development continues. The hallmark sign of success is formation of a dentinal bridge between the pulp wound and the capping material, which indicates healing and barrier formation. Pulp canal calcification or obliteration may occur but is not the primary objective. Periodontal ligament widening or periapical radiolucency indicates failure. Thus, dentinal bridge formation is considered the most reliable sign of treatment success.",2,,
Which of the following is NOT used as a therapeutic agent for pulpotomy in primary teeth?,Ferric sulfate,Formocresol,Calcium hydroxide,Glass ionomer cement,4,"<b>Explanation:</b><br>Glass ionomer cement is not a therapeutic agent for pulpotomy—it is used as a <b>base or restorative material</b> placed over the medicament.<br><br><b>Commonly used therapeutic agents include:</b><br>- <b>Formocresol</b>: Historically the gold standard; bactericidal and fixative but has <b>cytotoxic and mutagenic concerns</b>.<br>- <b>Ferric sulfate</b>: Works by hemostasis; avoids fixation but may cause <b>internal resorption</b> in some cases.<br>- <b>Glutaraldehyde</b>: Good fixative, less penetration than formocresol.<br>- <b>Calcium hydroxide</b>: Stimulates dentin bridge but <b>not ideal for primary teeth</b> due to internal resorption risk.<br>- <b>MTA</b> and <b>electrosurgery</b>: Biocompatible, modern alternatives with high success rates.<br><br><b>High-yield summary:</b><br>Formocresol, ferric sulfate, glutaraldehyde, MTA, and electrosurgery remain acceptable choices.

"During a pulpotomy procedure on a primary molar, the coronal pulp exhibits profuse, bright red bleeding that does not stop easily even after gentle pressure. What is the most appropriate management for this case?",Complete the pulpotomy and place formocresol,Place a calcium hydroxide liner and restore,Perform a pulpectomy and obturate the canals with a resorbable material,Extract the tooth immediately,3,"<b>Explanation:</b><br>Persistent, profuse bleeding after coronal pulp amputation indicates <b>irreversible pulpitis</b>, meaning inflammation has extended into the radicular pulp. A pulpotomy is contraindicated because remaining inflamed pulp would lead to necrosis.<br><br><b>Management decisions:</b><br>- <b>Normal vital pulp:</b> Controlled bleeding → proceed with <b>pulpotomy</b>.<br>- <b>Irreversible pulpitis:</b> Persistent bleeding → perform <b>pulpectomy</b>.<br>- <b>Necrotic pulp:</b> No bleeding → pulpectomy or extraction.<br><br><b>Summary table:</b><br><table style='width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;' border='1'><tr><th>Pulpal Condition</th><th>Bleeding</th><th>Treatment</th></tr><tr><td>Normal</td><td>Stops easily</td><td>Pulpotomy</td></tr><tr><td>Irreversible pulpitis</td><td>Persistent</td><td>Pulpectomy</td></tr><tr><td>Necrosis</td><td>None</td><td>Pulpectomy or extraction</td></tr></table><br><b>High-yield point:</b> Persistent bleeding = irreversible pulpitis → pulpectomy.",2,,
A 9-year-old patient presents with a recent traumatic fracture of an immature permanent incisor resulting in a small pulp exposure. The pulp tissue appears vital and bleeding but healthy. What is the most appropriate treatment to preserve vitality and allow continued root development?,Full pulpotomy with formocresol,Partial pulpotomy (Cvek’s pulpotomy),Pulpectomy and calcium hydroxide apexification,Extraction and reimplantation,2,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><b>Cvek’s pulpotomy</b> (partial pulpotomy) is a <b>vital pulp therapy</b> indicated for <b>traumatic pulp exposures</b> in <b>immature permanent teeth</b> with <b>vital pulp</b> and <b>open apices</b>.
