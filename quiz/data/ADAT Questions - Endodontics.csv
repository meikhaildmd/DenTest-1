"Gutta-percha, the standard root canal filling material in endodontics, is primarily derived from what natural source?",Petroleum resin,Tree sap (trans-polyisoprene),Calcium silicate cement,Zinc oxide–eugenol paste,2,"<b>Gutta-percha</b> is derived from the <b>sap of tropical Palaquium trees</b>. Its core polymer is <b>trans-polyisoprene</b>, a natural rubber-like material. In dentistry, gutta-percha cones are a composite of ~20% gutta-percha resin, ~60–75% zinc oxide, metal sulfates for radiopacity, and waxes/resins for handling.<br><br>It is biologically inert, radiopaque, and thermoplastic, making it ideal for obturation, though it requires a sealer to bond with dentin.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Natural origin = <b>tree sap</b><br>- Core = trans-polyisoprene<br>- Dental cones = gutta-percha + zinc oxide + additives",11,,
"During cleaning and shaping of root canals, why is the smear layer typically removed?",To prevent weakening of dentin,To enhance penetration of irrigants and sealers into dentinal tubules,To reduce fracture risk of endodontic instruments,To increase radiographic density of obturation material,2,"The <b>smear layer</b> is a thin film of debris formed during instrumentation, containing dentin particles, pulp remnants, and bacteria. It can harbor infection and block dentinal tubules.<br><br>Removal (commonly with <b>NaOCl + EDTA</b>) allows irrigants and sealers to penetrate dentinal tubules, improving disinfection and sealing quality.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Smear layer blocks irrigant/sealer penetration<br>- Removed with NaOCl (organic) + EDTA (inorganic)<br>- Improves hermetic seal and reduces reinfection",11,,
Which tooth root is most likely to contain two canals?,Distal root of mandibular first molar,Mesial root of mandibular first molar,Palatal root of maxillary first molar,Distobuccal root of maxillary second molar,2,"The <b>mesial root of the mandibular first molar</b> is the root most likely to have two canals (mesiobuccal and mesiolingual). Studies show >90% prevalence, though canals may remain separate or merge apically.<br><br>By contrast:<br>- Distal root of mandibular first molar: usually one wide canal, occasionally two.<br>- Palatal root of maxillary first molar: typically one large canal.<br>- Distobuccal root of maxillary molars: almost always one canal.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Most common site of 2 canals = mesial root of mandibular first molar<br>- MB + ML canals, >90% prevalence<br>- Key to avoid missed canals and endo failure",11,,
Adjusting the projection cone mesially during endodontic treatment may be indicated for:,Improving the tactile sensation of files within the canal to reduce risk of fracture,Obtaining a more accurate working length measurement by reducing image distortion,"Separating superimposed canals or roots on a radiograph, such as distinguishing mesiobuccal and mesiolingual canals of a mandibular molar",Increasing radiographic density to enhance visualization of obturation materials,3,"When roots or canals overlap in straight radiographs, the cone can be shifted mesially or distally, using the <b>SLOB rule (Same Lingual, Opposite Buccal)</b>. This separates superimposed structures, revealing hidden canals (e.g., MB vs ML canals of mandibular molars, or MB2 in maxillary molars).<br><br>Incorrect options:<br>- File sensation and fracture risk are mechanical, not radiographic issues.<br>- Working length accuracy relies on apex locators and straight radiographs.<br>- Radiographic density is exposure-related, not cone angulation.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Tube shift mesially = separates superimposed roots/canals<br>- Applies the SLOB rule<br>- Key for identifying extra canals and avoiding missed anatomy",11,,
What is the recommended treatment plan for a patient who presents with a primary endodontic lesion with secondary periodontal involvement?,"Periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing) first, then root canal treatment","Root canal therapy first, followed by periodontal therapy if needed",Simultaneous endodontic and periodontal therapy at the initial appointment,"Extraction of the tooth, as prognosis is always poor",2,"Endo-perio lesions are classified by origin. A <b>primary endodontic lesion</b> begins in the pulp, spreads to periradicular tissues, and can secondarily involve the periodontium.<br><br>Treatment: Always perform <b>root canal therapy first</b> because pulpal infection drives the process. After RCT, the periodontal status is reevaluated. Often, the perio component improves once the endodontic source is eliminated. If not, periodontal therapy follows.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Primary endo → secondary perio = <b>RCT first, then perio</b><br>- Extraction is not indicated unless prognosis is poor",11,,
"In endodontic diagnosis, what is the primary purpose of palpation testing?",To assess pulp vitality by stimulating nerve endings in the pulp,To evaluate periradicular inflammation and cortical bone expansion,To determine the presence of vertical root fractures,To identify canal curvature before instrumentation,2,"<b>Palpation testing</b> involves applying firm pressure over the mucosa near the root apex. It does not test pulp vitality but rather evaluates the <b>periapical tissues and cortical bone</b>.<br><br>A positive response indicates <b>periradicular inflammation</b> or <b>cortical bone expansion</b>. This test complements percussion (periodontal ligament inflammation) and pulp vitality tests.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Palpation = periapical tissues, not pulp<br>- Positive = tenderness, swelling, cortical expansion<br>- Used with percussion, vitality, and radiographs",11,,
What type of bacteria are most commonly associated with primary endodontic infections?,Facultative aerobes such as Streptococcus mutans,"Obligate anaerobes, predominantly Gram-negative rods",Fungi such as Candida albicans,Viruses such as Epstein–Barr virus,2,"Primary endodontic infections occur in necrotic pulp where oxygen is depleted. This favors colonization by <b>obligate anaerobic bacteria</b>, especially <b>Gram-negative rods</b> and spirochetes such as <i>Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Treponema</i>.<br><br>These organisms produce enzymes and endotoxins that cause periapical inflammation and bone resorption.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Primary lesions = obligate anaerobes (Gram-negative)<br>- Thrive in necrotic pulp<br>- Responsible for abscesses and radiolucencies",11,,
Which microorganisms are most often implicated in secondary endodontic infections (persistent/recurrent after treatment)?,Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus,Lactobacillus acidophilus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,1,"Secondary endodontic infections develop after root canal treatment due to persistent or reintroduced microbes. The most common is <b>Enterococcus faecalis</b>, a facultative anaerobe that:<br>- Survives in nutrient-poor canals<br>- Tolerates high pH, resisting calcium hydroxide<br>- Forms resilient biofilms on dentin<br><br>Other possible organisms include <i>Candida albicans</i>, but <b>E. faecalis</b> is the hallmark.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Secondary infection = <b>E. faecalis</b><br>- Main cause of post-treatment endodontic failure",11,,
Which of the following best describes the desirable properties of an ideal endodontic root-end filling material?,"Radiopaque, resorbable, soluble, and cytotoxic","Radiolucent, biocompatible, dimensionally unstable, and moisture-sensitive","Radiopaque, biocompatible, dimensionally stable, and provides an effective seal","Radiolucent, inexpensive, and requires no sealer for adaptation",3,"An ideal root-end filling material must create a hermetic seal and be compatible with periapical tissues.<br><br><b>Desirable properties:</b><br>- <b>Biocompatibility</b>: non-toxic to tissues<br>- <b>Radiopacity</b>: distinguishable on radiographs<br>- <b>Dimensional stability</b>: no shrinkage or expansion<br>- <b>Insolubility</b>: resists dissolution in fluids<br>- <b>Excellent sealing</b>: prevents bacterial leakage<br>- <b>Promotes healing</b>: e.g., MTA and bioceramics encourage cementogenesis<br><br>Incorrect options: solubility, radiolucency, and cytotoxicity are unacceptable.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Root-end filling must be <b>biocompatible, radiopaque, dimensionally stable, insoluble, and sealing</b><br>- <b>MTA</b> is the gold standard",11,,
All of the following are indications for periapical surgery (apicoectomy) EXCEPT:,Persistent periapical pathology despite technically adequate root canal treatment,Anatomical obstructions such as calcified canals or root dilacerations preventing complete debridement,"Iatrogenic complications (e.g., separated instrument, perforation) not amenable to nonsurgical retreatment","Endodontic failure, without attempting nonsurgical retreatment first",4,"Periapical surgery is indicated only when nonsurgical retreatment is not feasible. If root canal treatment has failed, the first line of management is <b>nonsurgical retreatment</b> whenever possible.<br><br><b>Retreatment is indicated when:</b><br>- Previous obturation is inadequate<br>- Coronal leakage is suspected<br>- Missed canals can be re-accessed<br>- Instruments and canal anatomy permit re-treatment<br><br><b>Apicoectomy is indicated when:</b><br>- Obstructions prevent nonsurgical cleaning (calcification, dilaceration)<br>- Iatrogenic factors (separated instrument, post) cannot be corrected<br>- Persistent pathology despite adequate retreatment<br><br>Thus, <b>endodontic failure alone is not an automatic indication</b> for surgery. Standard sequence: RCT → Retreatment (if possible) → Apicoectomy if retreatment is not feasible or has failed.",11,,
A patient presents long after a traumatic dental injury. The involved tooth appears pink in color. Which type of resorption is most likely?,External surface resorption,External inflammatory resorption,Internal resorption,Replacement resorption (ankylosis),3,"A <b>pink tooth</b> is pathognomonic for <b>internal resorption</b>. Resorption begins within the pulp chamber/canal, where odontoclast-like cells resorb dentin. The vascular resorptive tissue makes the crown appear pink (""pink tooth of Mummery"").<br><br><b>Types of resorption:</b><br>- Internal: pulp-driven, causes canal enlargement, pink discoloration.<br>- External surface: small, self-limiting defects on root surface, usually after trauma.<br>- External inflammatory: pulp necrosis + PDL damage, leads to rapid root loss.<br>- Replacement (ankylosis): root surface replaced by bone, tooth becomes ankylosed.<br><br>Treatment for internal resorption = RCT before perforation occurs.",11,,
A 9-year-old patient presents with an immature permanent incisor with carious pulp exposure. Pulp testing indicates vitality. What is the most appropriate treatment?,Apexogenesis (vital pulp therapy) to preserve pulp vitality and allow root development,Apexification with MTA to create an apical barrier,Root canal therapy with gutta-percha obturation,Regenerative endodontic procedure using triple antibiotic paste,1,"Management depends on pulp vitality.<br><br><b>Vital pulp therapy (VPT):</b> The pulp is alive. Options include indirect/direct pulp capping, partial pulpotomy, full pulpotomy, and apexogenesis. Apexogenesis specifically preserves pulp vitality in immature teeth, allowing root length and dentin thickness to continue developing.<br><br><b>Non-vital pulp therapy:</b> Performed when pulp is necrotic. Includes apexification (artificial apical barrier with MTA/bioceramic) and regenerative endodontics. Regeneration uses <b>triple antibiotic paste</b> (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, minocycline) to disinfect necrotic canals before inducing bleeding and sealing with MTA.<br><br>In this case, since the pulp is vital, the correct choice is <b>apexogenesis</b>.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Apexogenesis = vital pulp therapy for immature teeth<br>- Apexification = non-vital, creates apical barrier<br>- Regeneration = non-vital, allows continued development using triple antibiotic paste",11,,
What is considered the greatest disadvantage of MTA apexification in immature permanent teeth?,It is cytotoxic to periapical tissues,"It prevents continued root development and results in thin, fracture-prone dentinal walls",It has poor sealing ability compared to calcium hydroxide,It cannot set in the presence of moisture,2,"MTA apexification creates an artificial apical barrier quickly and predictably. It is biocompatible, sets in moisture, and seals well.<br><br>However, the <b>greatest disadvantage</b> is that root development does not continue. The tooth retains thin, fragile dentinal walls and is at risk of fracture. This is the limitation of all apexification procedures compared to apexogenesis or regenerative therapy.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- MTA apexification = fast, biocompatible barrier<br>- Main drawback = no further root maturation → thin, fracture-prone roots",11,,
A 10-year-old patient presents with an immature permanent tooth that has a necrotic pulp and an open apex. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment to promote continued root development and apical closure?,Calcium hydroxide apexification,Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) apexification,Regenerative endodontic procedure using triple antibiotic paste,Extraction and replacement with a space maintainer,3,"<b>Regenerative endodontics (revascularization)</b> is a biologically based procedure aimed at allowing a previously necrotic immature tooth to continue developing root length and dentin thickness. It relies on three essential components: <b>stem cells, growth factors, and a scaffold</b> within a disinfected canal space.<br><br><b>Procedure overview:</b><br>1. <b>Disinfection phase:</b> Minimal or no instrumentation, irrigation with 1.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA, then placement of <b>triple antibiotic paste</b> (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, minocycline) for 1–4 weeks.<br>2. <b>Induce bleeding:</b> After medicament removal, a sterile file is extended beyond the apex to induce bleeding into the canal — forming a scaffold of stem cells.<br>3. <b>Seal and restore:</b> Place MTA or bioceramic over the clot and restore permanently.<br><br><b>Advantages:</b><br>- Allows continued root development and apical closure<br>- Strengthens dentinal walls, reducing fracture risk<br>- May restore limited pulp vitality<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Indication: necrotic immature teeth<br>- Disinfection: triple antibiotic paste (cipro + metro + mino)<br>- Goal: continued root maturation and apical closure<br>- Scaffold: blood clot or PRP<br>- Coronal seal: MTA or bioceramic",11,,
A 9-year-old patient sustains a complicated crown fracture with a small pulpal exposure of a maxillary central incisor. The pulp is vital and asymptomatic. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?,Full pulpotomy with MTA and immediate crown placement,Partial (Cvek) pulpotomy with calcium hydroxide or MTA,Apexification with calcium hydroxide,Direct pulp capping with zinc oxide–eugenol,2,"A <b>Cvek pulpotomy</b> (partial pulpotomy) is the treatment of choice for vital immature permanent teeth with <b>small traumatic pulp exposures</b> (complicated crown fractures). The goal is to preserve pulp vitality and allow continued root development (<b>apexogenesis</b>).<br><br><b>Indications:</b><br>- Small, recent pulp exposures (<24 hours)<br>- Vital, asymptomatic pulp<br>- Immature permanent tooth with open apex<br><br><b>Procedure:</b><br>1. Remove 1–2 mm of inflamed pulp under coolant<br>2. Achieve hemostasis with saline or NaOCl<br>3. Cover with <b>Ca(OH)₂, MTA, or bioceramic</b><br>4. Restore permanently to prevent leakage<br><br><b>Outcome:</b> High success rate (>90%) with continued root maturation.<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Complicated fracture → pulp exposure → partial pulpotomy<br>- Uncomplicated fracture → no pulp exposure → restoration only<br>- Goal: maintain vitality for apexogenesis",11,,
"A 15-year-old patient presents with an extrusive luxation of tooth #8 following trauma. The tooth is displaced coronally, tender to touch, and mobile but the root is intact. What is the most appropriate management?",Extract the tooth and place a space maintainer,Reposition the tooth gently into its socket and stabilize with a flexible splint,Allow spontaneous repositioning and monitor for re-eruption,Perform immediate root canal therapy and splint the tooth rigidly,2,"<b>Management of Extrusive Luxation</b><br><br>Extrusive luxation is a partial displacement of the tooth out of its socket due to damage to the <b>periodontal ligament (PDL)</b> and apical neurovascular bundle.<br><br>For a 15-year-old, the apex is typically closed, but revascularization is still possible. The tooth should be <b>repositioned gently</b> into its socket and stabilized with a <b>flexible splint</b> for approximately <b>2 weeks</b>.<br><br>Rigid splints are avoided since they can cause ankylosis by restricting physiologic movement. Pulp vitality should be monitored; if necrosis develops, <b>root canal therapy</b> is initiated.<br><br><b>Additional care:</b> soft diet, chlorhexidine rinses, avoid further trauma, and antibiotics (amoxicillin or azithromycin).<br><br><b>High-yield recap:</b><br>- Reposition tooth and splint for 2 weeks<br>- Use <b>flexible</b> splint (not rigid)<br>- Monitor vitality and initiate RCT if necrosis develops",11,,
Which of the following correctly lists the histological zones of the dental pulp from the outermost (closest to dentin) to the innermost layer?,Odontoblastic layer → Cell-free zone → Cell-rich zone → Pulp core,Cell-free zone → Odontoblastic layer → Cell-rich zone → Pulp core,Predentin → Odontoblastic layer → Pulp core → Cell-free zone,Cell-rich zone → Odontoblastic layer → Cell-free zone → Pulp core,1,"<div style='border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;overflow:hidden;margin:8px 0;'>

Which of the following statements best explains why the prognosis is generally better when an instrument fracture occurs later in the root canal procedure rather than earlier?,Because more bacterial reduction has already occurred through instrumentation and irrigation,Because later-stage instruments are smaller and easier to remove,Because later fractures occur farther from the apex,Because obturation materials seal the canal immediately after fracture,1,"A file fracture late in endodontic treatment occurs after most shaping and disinfection have been completed, meaning fewer bacteria remain in the canal. This improves prognosis compared to early fracture, where much of the canal remains untreated and infected.<br><br>Prognosis depends on fracture location and ability to bypass or obturate. Late-stage fractures often do not require surgical intervention if adequate cleaning has been achieved and healing occurs radiographically.",11,,
"During an apicoectomy, which of the following materials is considered the gold standard for root-end (retrograde) filling?",Amalgam,Glass ionomer cement,Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA),Super EBA,3,"<b>Explanation:</b><br>
During an apicoectomy, the apical portion of the root is surgically resected, and a root-end filling material is placed to seal the canal and prevent bacterial leakage. The ideal root-end filling should be <b>biocompatible</b>, <b>dimensionally stable</b>, <b>moisture-tolerant</b>, <b>radiopaque</b>, and capable of forming a tight seal with the root dentin.<br><br>
<b>Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA)</b> fulfills these criteria better than any other material, making it the <b>gold standard</b> for apical retrofills. It promotes <b>cementogenesis</b> and <b>osteogenesis</b>, allowing the body to regenerate periradicular tissues naturally.<br><br>
Earlier materials such as <b>amalgam</b> and <b>Super EBA</b> were once common but are now largely replaced due to problems like microleakage, corrosion, and tissue irritation. MTA’s ability to set in the presence of moisture and its bioactive interface with dentin provide an ideal apical seal that promotes long-term healing.<br><br>
<b>High-Yield Review:</b><br>
• MTA = gold standard for root-end filling in apicoectomy<br>
• Stimulates cementum and bone formation<br>
• Sets in moist environments<br>
• Better sealing and biocompatibility than amalgam or EBA<br>
• Modern alternatives → Biodentine, EndoSequence BC RRM (similar performance, easier handling)",11,,
