"A 42-year-old woman presents with progressive weight gain, particularly around the trunk and face. She reports easy bruising, new-onset hypertension, and muscle weakness. On exam, she has a round “moon” face, supraclavicular fat pads, and purple abdominal striae.",Addison’s disease,Cushing’s disease,Hypothyroidism,Acromegaly,2,"Cushing’s disease is a form of Cushing’s syndrome that results specifically from an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The pathophysiology involves excess ACTH production, which overstimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete high levels of cortisol. In laboratory findings, patients typically demonstrate elevated cortisol and elevated ACTH. Classic features include central (truncal) obesity, moon facies, and a dorsocervical fat pad (“buffalo hump”), along with purple striae and easy bruising due to protein catabolism and impaired collagen synthesis. This hormone pattern is crucial in distinguishing Cushing’s disease from other causes of hypercortisolism: adrenal tumors (high cortisol with suppressed ACTH), ectopic ACTH production (very high ACTH and cortisol with abrupt onset and possible hypokalemia), and exogenous glucocorticoid use (high cortisol, suppressed ACTH, adrenal atrophy).",3,,
Mastoid ecchymosis (Battle’s sign) is most commonly associated with which type of skull fracture?,Depressed skull fracture,Linear parietal fracture,Basilar skull fracture,Temporal bone fracture only,3,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><b>Battle’s sign</b> refers to postauricular ecchymosis (bruising over the mastoid process) due to extravasation of blood from a <b>basilar skull fracture</b> involving the <b>temporal bone</b>.<br><br>This finding indicates a fracture through the petrous portion of the temporal bone, often accompanied by <b>CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea</b>, hemotympanum, and cranial nerve deficits (especially CN VII and VIII). Immediate evaluation is warranted due to risk of meningitis and brainstem injury.",3,,
"A 13-year-old boy is evaluated for rapid growth and tall stature far above his peers. He has enlarged hands and feet, excessive sweating, and headaches. Imaging reveals a pituitary mass secreting growth hormone. Which of the following terms best describes his condition?",Acromegaly,Gigantism,Marfan syndrome,Hyperthyroidism,2,"Excess growth hormone (GH) produces different syndromes depending on epiphyseal plate status. Gigantism occurs in children and adolescents before epiphyseal closure, causing excessive linear bone growth and extreme tall stature; patients may also show coarse facial features, large hands and feet, and cardiovascular complications. In contrast, acromegaly occurs in adults after epiphyseal closure, leading to soft tissue and appositional bone growth with coarse facial features, prognathism, enlarged hands/feet, organomegaly, and metabolic disturbances. Both are most commonly due to a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma and are evaluated with elevated IGF-1 levels and failure of GH suppression on oral glucose testing.",3,,
Which of the following best differentiates neoplasia from metaplasia?,Neoplasia is abnormal tissue proliferation; metaplasia is a reversible change of one cell type to another,Neoplasia is always malignant; metaplasia is always benign,Neoplasia involves only epithelial cells; metaplasia involves only connective tissue cells,Neoplasia results in apoptosis; metaplasia prevents apoptosis,1,"Neoplasia refers to new, uncontrolled, and abnormal growth of cells that is not coordinated with normal tissue architecture. It can be benign or malignant but, by definition, persists even after the stimulus is removed. Metaplasia, on the other hand, is a reversible change in which one differentiated cell type is replaced by another that is better able to withstand stress (e.g., squamous metaplasia in the bronchi of smokers, or Barrett’s esophagus where squamous → columnar epithelium). Importantly, metaplasia itself is not malignant but can predispose to dysplasia and eventually neoplasia if the irritant persists. High-yield review: Neoplasia—abnormal proliferation, persists without stimulus, may be benign or malignant. Metaplasia—reversible cell type conversion, adaptive response, may predispose to dysplasia. Clinical correlation: Barrett’s esophagus = intestinal metaplasia → adenocarcinoma risk.",3,,
Which of the following rare renal cancers originates from the collecting ducts of the kidney?,Clear cell carcinoma,Papillary renal carcinoma,Bellini duct carcinoma,Chromophobe carcinoma,3,"Collecting duct carcinoma (also known as Bellini duct carcinoma) is a rare and aggressive renal carcinoma that arises from the epithelial cells of the collecting ducts in the renal medulla. It accounts for less than 1% of renal carcinomas but is clinically significant due to its poor prognosis. Patients often present with hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable mass, similar to other renal carcinomas, but the location in the medulla helps distinguish it. High-yield review: Origin—collecting ducts (Bellini ducts). Aggressive clinical course, poor prognosis. Rare (<1% of renal carcinomas). Mnemonic: “Drinking Bellinis makes you pee” → collecting ducts in the kidney medulla.",3,,
McCune-Albright syndrome is characterized by which of the following triads?,"Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, café-au-lait spots, endocrine hyperfunction","Monostotic fibrous dysplasia, café-au-lait spots, renal failure","Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, hypopigmented macules, adrenal insufficiency","Monostotic fibrous dysplasia, neurofibromas, hyperthyroidism",1,"<b>Explanation:</b><br><b>McCune-Albright syndrome</b> is a rare genetic disorder caused by postzygotic activating mutations in the <b>GNAS gene</b>, leading to constitutive activation of Gsα protein and overproduction of cAMP in affected tissues.<br><br>The classic triad includes:<br>• <b>Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia</b> — abnormal fibro-osseous tissue replaces normal bone, leading to deformities and fractures.<br>• <b>Café-au-lait skin macules</b> — irregular (“coast of Maine”) borders.<br>• <b>Endocrine hyperfunction</b> — most commonly precocious puberty, but can also include hyperthyroidism, Cushing’s, or acromegaly.<br><br>This mosaic distribution explains why disease severity varies based on when the mutation occurred during embryogenesis.",3,,
Pheochromocytoma is a tumor arising from which of the following cell types?,Zona glomerulosa cells,Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla,Parafollicular C cells of the thyroid,Anterior pituitary corticotrophs,2,"Pheochromocytoma is a neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal medulla that arises from chromaffin cells, which normally secrete catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine). Excess hormone release leads to episodic hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and sweating—classically described as spells. It is sometimes called the “10% tumor” (10% extra-adrenal, 10% bilateral, 10% malignant, etc.), though this is being revised with newer genetics. Pheochromocytoma is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), von Hippel–Lindau disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1. High-yield review: Cell of origin—chromaffin cells (neural crest derived). Hormones—epinephrine/norepinephrine → secondary hypertension. Clinical triad: headache, palpitations, diaphoresis. Associations: NF1, MEN2A/2B, VHL disease. Mnemonic: “Pheo = pressure spikes from catecholamines.”",3,,
Peutz–Jeghers syndrome is characterized by which of the following findings?,Hamartomatous polyps in the colon and melanotic macules on lips,Adenomatous polyps of colon with APC mutation,Sessile serrated adenomas with KRAS mutation,Multiple juvenile polyps with increased risk of adenocarcinoma,1,"Peutz–Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, especially the small intestine and colon, along with mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation (melanotic macules) on the lips, buccal mucosa, and digits. While the polyps are benign hamartomas, patients have an increased lifetime risk of both GI and extra-GI malignancies, including pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers. High-yield review: Genetics—autosomal dominant, STK11 mutation. Findings—GI polyps + mucocutaneous pigmentation. Cancer risk—GI, pancreas, breast, ovary, uterus.",3,,
Esophageal varices most commonly arise as a complication of which underlying condition?,Portal hypertension from cirrhosis,Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),Mallory–Weiss tear,Peptic ulcer disease,1,"Esophageal varices are dilated submucosal veins in the lower esophagus that form due to portal hypertension, most often from cirrhosis of the liver. Fibrosis and nodular regeneration in cirrhosis increase resistance to portal venous flow, diverting blood through collateral pathways including the left gastric vein into esophageal veins. These fragile varices may rupture, leading to massive hematemesis and hypovolemic shock. Mortality is high with first bleeding episodes. High-yield review: Cause—portal hypertension (cirrhosis). Clinical—hematemesis, shock. Pathology—dilated distal esophageal submucosal veins. Management—band ligation, octreotide, TIPS shunt.",3,,
A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic sun exposure develops a slowly enlarging brown patch on the side of his nose. Biopsy is most consistent with:,Seborrheic keratosis,Lentigo maligna,Basal cell carcinoma,Actinic keratosis,2,"Lentigo maligna is a melanoma in situ that develops on chronically sun-damaged skin, especially of the head and neck in older adults. It appears as a slowly enlarging, asymmetric brown or black patch with irregular borders. Histologically, there is atypical melanocyte proliferation along the basal layer. Without treatment, it may progress to invasive melanoma. High-yield review: Type—melanoma in situ. Location—sun-exposed skin (face, nose, cheeks). Demographic—elderly, fair-skinned. Appearance—irregular pigmented patch. Risk—progression to invasive melanoma if untreated.",3,,

Which viral component is most commonly used to generate protective vaccines?,Viral RNA genome,Capsid proteins,"Viral glycoproteins (e.g., hemagglutinin, neuraminidase)",Viral polymerase enzymes,3,"Vaccines are designed to elicit an immune response against viral surface antigens. The most effective targets are viral glycoproteins such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These proteins are highly antigenic and accessible to neutralizing antibodies. Option 1 (RNA genome) is not exposed to the immune system. Option 2 (capsid proteins) can be antigenic but are not the primary target of most modern vaccines. Option 4 (polymerase enzymes) are internal proteins, poorly immunogenic. High-yield review: Viral glycoproteins are the major vaccine targets: influenza HA/NA, HBV surface antigen, SARS-CoV-2 spike.",3,,

It is a thymidine analog that incorporates into viral DNA and terminates chain elongation, preventing HIV reverse transcriptase from completing DNA synthesis. Option 1 (protease inhibitors) includes drugs like indinavir or ritonavir. Option 3 (integrase inhibitors) includes raltegravir. Option 4 (cell wall synthesis inhibitors) applies to antibiotics, not antivirals. High-yield review: AZT = thymidine analog, NRTI, inhibits reverse transcriptase. Key in HAART. Do not confuse with azithromycin (macrolide antibiotic).",3,,
A 45-year-old woman presents with chronic dry mouth and gritty sensation in her eyes. She also has swelling of the parotid glands. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Rheumatoid arthritis,Sjögren’s syndrome,Hypothyroidism,Sarcoidosis,2,"Sjögren’s syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands, producing xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). Middle-aged women are most affected, and it is often associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical signs include difficulty swallowing dry food, cervical caries, and parotid gland enlargement. Hypothyroidism can also cause dry mouth but not eye symptoms, rheumatoid arthritis is comorbid but not causal, and sarcoidosis usually involves lungs and systemic granulomas rather than sicca syndrome. High-yield review: autoimmune destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands, anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, associated with RA and SLE, increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",3,,
A 60-year-old patient presents with painful vesicular lesions distributed along a unilateral thoracic dermatome. He reports a history of chickenpox as a child. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Herpes simplex virus infection,Molluscum contagiosum,Recurrent varicella-zoster (shingles),Hand-foot-and-mouth disease,3,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a herpesvirus, causes two distinct syndromes. Primary infection is varicella (chickenpox), a diffuse vesicular rash in children. After resolution, the virus remains latent in dorsal root or cranial nerve ganglia. Reactivation produces herpes zoster (shingles), presenting as painful vesicles limited to one dermatome. Herpes simplex virus causes mucocutaneous lesions but not dermatomal vesicles. Molluscum contagiosum (poxvirus) causes dome-shaped umbilicated papules. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (coxsackievirus A16) causes oral ulcers and vesicles on hands/feet in children. High-yield: VZV → chickenpox (primary), shingles (reactivation), dorsal root ganglia latency, complication = postherpetic neuralgia.",3,,
Which of the following organisms is responsible for endemic (murine) typhus?,Rickettsia prowazekii,Rickettsia typhi,Coxiella burnetii,Borrelia burgdorferi,2,"Endemic (murine) typhus is caused by Rickettsia typhi and is typically transmitted by fleas from rodent reservoirs. Clinical features include fever, headache, myalgias, and a trunk-centered rash that may be mild or absent; disease severity is generally less than epidemic typhus. By contrast, Rickettsia prowazekii causes epidemic typhus via the human body louse and produces a more severe systemic illness in crowded or unsanitary conditions. Coxiella burnetii causes Q fever (inhaled aerosols from livestock, classically no rash). Borrelia burgdorferi is a tick-borne spirochete that causes Lyme disease with erythema migrans and potential neurologic or cardiac involvement. High-yield: Endemic typhus = R. typhi (fleas); Epidemic typhus = R. prowazekii (lice).",3,,
Which pathogen is the causative agent of Q fever?,Rickettsia rickettsii,Coxiella burnetii,Rickettsia typhi,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,2,"Q fever is caused by Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular bacterium acquired by inhalation of aerosolized particles from infected cattle, sheep, or goats; no arthropod bite is required. The illness ranges from high fever and severe headache to hepatitis or atypical pneumonia, and unlike most rickettsioses, a rash is often absent. Rickettsia rickettsii causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever (tick-borne with centrifugal rash starting at wrists/ankles). Rickettsia typhi causes endemic typhus (flea-borne). Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes atypical 'walking' pneumonia in young adults. High-yield: Q fever = C. burnetii (aerosol from livestock, usually no rash).",3,,
Which bacterial group is most commonly associated with subacute infective endocarditis?,Staphylococcus aureus,Enterococcus faecalis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Viridans group streptococci (α-hemolytic),4,"Subacute infective endocarditis classically arises on previously damaged or abnormal valves (e.g., rheumatic heart disease, congenital lesions) due to Viridans group streptococci (alpha-hemolytic oral flora such as Streptococcus sanguinis and S. mitis). These organisms adhere to platelet–fibrin deposits following transient bacteremia, including after dental procedures. Staphylococcus aureus typically causes acute, rapidly destructive endocarditis on normal valves (common in IV drug use). Enterococcus faecalis is a less common cause often associated with genitourinary or gastrointestinal instrumentation. Streptococcus pneumoniae is primarily linked to pneumonia and meningitis rather than endocarditis. High-yield: Subacute = Viridans (damaged valves, indolent); Acute = S. aureus (normal valves, severe).",3,,
The lesion of primary syphilis is best described as:,A painful vesicle (herpes simplex),A painless hard chancre,"A soft, painful chancroid",A recurrent aphthous ulcer,2,"Primary syphilis (Treponema pallidum) presents 2–3 weeks after exposure with a solitary, firm, indurated, painless ulcer (hard chancre) at the inoculation site and regional, often painless lymphadenopathy; the chancre heals spontaneously in 3–6 weeks even without therapy. Herpes simplex causes clusters of painful vesicles and ulcers with tender nodes. Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, a soft, painful ulcer with ragged edges and painful inguinal adenopathy. Aphthous ulcers are recurrent, painful oral ulcers unrelated to sexually transmitted infections. High-yield: Primary syphilis = painless hard chancre; Herpes = painful vesicles; Chancroid = soft painful ulcer.",3,,
The largest component of extracellular fluid (ECF) is:,Plasma,Interstitial fluid,Lymph,Intracellular fluid,2,"Total body water is divided into intracellular fluid (ICF, ~2/3 of total body water) and extracellular fluid (ECF, ~1/3). ECF is further partitioned into interstitial fluid (~75% of ECF), which bathes cells and facilitates exchange, and plasma (~25% of ECF), the circulating component within blood vessels; lymph constitutes a minor fraction. Therefore, interstitial fluid is the largest single component of ECF. High-yield: ICF ≈ 2/3 TBW; ECF ≈ 1/3 TBW → Interstitial (~75% of ECF) > Plasma (~25% of ECF).",3,,
Which genetic defect is linked to the X-linked form of amelogenesis imperfecta?,Mutation in collagen type I gene,Missense mutation in enamelin gene,Deletion in the amelogenin gene (AMELX) spanning intron 2 to the last exon,Mutation in dentin sialophosphoprotein gene,3,"The X-linked form of amelogenesis imperfecta arises from pathogenic variants in AMELX, encoding amelogenin, a major enamel matrix protein. A documented lesion involves a deletion extending from intron 2 to the last exon, impairing enamel matrix secretion and mineralization and producing thin, hypoplastic or hypomaturation enamel that fractures easily. Collagen type I mutations are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta, not enamel defects. Enamelin mutations cause autosomal dominant forms of AI, and DSPP mutations cause dentinogenesis imperfecta. High-yield: X-linked AI = AMELX; autosomal AI = enamelin (ENAM) and others.",3,,
"Aflatoxin, a potent hepatocarcinogen, is produced by:",Candida albicans,Aspergillus species,Clostridium botulinum,Staphylococcus aureus,2,"Aflatoxins (especially aflatoxin B1) are mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus that contaminate grains, corn, and peanuts in warm, humid climates. Chronic ingestion leads to hepatotoxicity and a markedly increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, partly via mutagenic adducts to the p53 tumor suppressor gene (classically at codon 249). Candida albicans causes mucocutaneous candidiasis, Clostridium botulinum produces neurotoxic botulinum toxin, and Staphylococcus aureus produces enterotoxins causing rapid-onset food poisoning. High-yield: Aflatoxin = Aspergillus → HCC risk (synergistic with chronic HBV).",3,,
Which of the following are obligate intracellular pathogens?,Chlamydia and Rickettsia,Mycoplasma and Streptococcus,Borrelia and Treponema,Staphylococcus and E. coli,1,"Obligate intracellular organisms must replicate within host cells because they lack sufficient metabolic machinery for independent growth. Classic examples are Chlamydia (energy parasites lacking a complete ATP-generating system) and Rickettsia (require host cytosol). Plasmodium (protozoan) and Coxiella burnetii are also commonly included as obligate intracellular pathogens. Mycoplasma (cell wall–deficient), Borrelia and Treponema (spirochetes), and Staphylococcus/E. coli are not obligate intracellular. High-yield: Obligates = Chlamydia, Rickettsia, Plasmodium, Coxiella; Mycobacterium is facultative intracellular.",3,,
Myasthenia gravis is most commonly associated with which pathological condition of the thymus?,Thymic cyst,Thymoma,Thymic aplasia,Thymic hyperplasia only,2,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder in which antibodies target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, impairing synaptic transmission and causing fluctuating muscle weakness. Symptoms include ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, and generalized fatigue that worsens with exertion and improves with rest. There is a strong association between MG and thymic abnormalities, particularly thymoma (tumor of thymic epithelial cells) and thymic hyperplasia. A thymectomy can induce remission in many patients, especially when a thymoma is present, although remission may not always be permanent. 👉 High-yield review: Cause: Autoantibodies against nicotinic ACh receptors. Symptoms: Weakness worsens with exertion, improves with rest. Associated with: Thymoma, thymic hyperplasia. Treatment: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, immunosuppressants, thymectomy if thymoma present.",3,,
Which of the following best differentiates Histoplasmosis from general mycoses?,"Histoplasmosis is a specific systemic fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, whereas 'mycoses' refers broadly to fungal diseases.","Histoplasmosis primarily affects the skin, whereas mycoses affect only the lungs.","Histoplasmosis is a bacterial infection, whereas mycoses are viral infections.","Histoplasmosis is limited to immunocompromised patients, whereas mycoses occur only in healthy hosts.",1,"Mycoses represent the broad category of fungal diseases, which may be superficial (skin, hair, nails), cutaneous (dermatophytoses), subcutaneous (sporotrichosis), opportunistic (mucormycosis in diabetics), or systemic. Inhalation of fungal spores or localized colonization of the skin can initiate persistent infections. Histoplasmosis, by contrast, is one specific type of systemic mycosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. Nicknamed 'Spelunker’s Lung' or 'Caver’s Disease', it is acquired by inhalation of spores from bird or bat droppings in caves or old buildings. The disease primarily affects the lungs, producing granulomatous inflammation that can mimic tuberculosis. In immunocompetent people it is often self-limited, but in immunocompromised patients (especially AIDS) it can disseminate to multiple organs and become life-threatening. High-yield contrasts: Mycoses = broad fungal infections (superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous, systemic, opportunistic). Histoplasmosis = specific systemic mycosis with pulmonary onset, TB-like granulomas, potential dissemination, worsens in immunocompromised patients.",3,,
Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus are particularly predisposed to developing mucormycosis due to which of the following mechanisms?,"Elevated serum glucose impairs neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis, facilitating fungal invasion.",Excess insulin secretion promotes growth of fungal hyphae in vascular tissues.,Increased bicarbonate buffering neutralizes acidic conditions required for fungal proliferation.,Enhanced T-cell function in hyperglycemia provides a favorable niche for fungal growth.,1,"Mucormycosis is an aggressive, opportunistic fungal infection caused by organisms of the order Mucorales (commonly Rhizopus species). It is strongly associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, particularly in the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Hyperglycemia and acidosis impair neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative burst, leading to ineffective clearance of fungal spores. Elevated free iron in acidosis further enhances fungal proliferation. The fungi characteristically invade vascular structures, causing tissue necrosis and black eschar formation in the nasal cavity, sinuses, or palate. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is the most common presentation in diabetic patients, beginning with sinusitis-like symptoms and potentially progressing to orbital and brain involvement. Early recognition and management are critical, requiring antifungal therapy (amphotericin B), surgical debridement, and strict glycemic control. High-yield points: Risk factor: uncontrolled diabetes, especially DKA. Pathogenesis: impaired neutrophil function + increased free iron. Clinical: rapidly progressive rhinocerebral infection with tissue necrosis. Treatment: amphotericin B + surgical debridement + correction of hyperglycemia.",3,,
