Which of the following statements best describes the purpose of microgrooved and roughened implant surfaces compared to machined (smooth) implants?,They reduce bone contact to prevent implant overloading,They enhance osseointegration by increasing surface area for bone attachment,They are primarily used to prevent soft tissue proliferation along the implant collar,They delay healing to allow for gradual fibrous encapsulation,2,"<b>Implant Surface Types and Their Role in Osseointegration</b><br><br>Modern implants use <b>roughened or microgrooved surfaces</b> (SLA, RBM, anodized, HA-coated) to <b>increase surface area</b> and <b>enhance bone-to-implant contact (BIC)</b>. This leads to faster and stronger osseointegration.<ul><li><b>Machined (smooth):</b> Slower healing, fibrous tissue risk.</li><li><b>Roughened:</b> Faster bone apposition, shorter healing (6–8 weeks).</li><li><b>Coated:</b> Hydroxyapatite or CaP coatings improve biocompatibility.</li></ul>",13,,
