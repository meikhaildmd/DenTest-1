A patient refuses extraction of a hopeless tooth despite the dentist’s recommendation. Respecting the patient’s right to decide reflects which ethical principle?,Beneficence,Autonomy,Nonmaleficence,Justice,2,"Autonomy is the principle that patients have the right to make decisions about their own healthcare, provided they are informed and competent.

A dentist feels uncomfortable performing a complex surgical procedure on a patient because they believe it may cause harm due to limited experience. Which ethical principle is guiding the dentist’s decision?,Autonomy,Non-maleficence,Justice,Beneficence,2,"Non-maleficence (“do no harm”) obligates clinicians to avoid interventions when the risk of injury outweighs the benefit or when the provider lacks the skill, experience, or resources to perform the procedure safely; in such cases the ethical response is to decline and refer to a qualified clinician. By contrast, autonomy concerns honoring informed choices, beneficence involves actively promoting the patient’s welfare, and justice addresses fairness and equitable access to care.",8,,
