"During endodontic treatment of a maxillary first molar, the clinician prepares the access cavity and negotiates the mesiobuccal canal. Which additional step is most critical for ensuring long-term success of treatment in this tooth?",Ensuring patency of the distobuccal root canal,Identifying and treating the MB2 canal in the mesiobuccal root,Over-instrumenting the palatal canal to confirm working length,Placing a post immediately in the palatal canal,2,"Endodontic success in maxillary first molars depends on careful management of the mesiobuccal root, which often contains two canals. The MB2 canal is typically located palatal and slightly mesial to MB1 on the chamber floor, and may be very narrow or calcified. Failure to locate and instrument MB2 is one of the leading causes of endodontic failure in these teeth, as untreated tissue can harbor bacteria and cause persistent periapical disease. Magnification, enhanced illumination, and ultrasonic troughing are often used to find MB2. By contrast, the distobuccal and palatal roots almost always have a single canal and pose fewer anatomical challenges.",5,,
Which anterior tooth is most likely to contain two root canals?,Maxillary central incisor,Mandibular lateral incisor,Maxillary canine,Mandibular canine,2,"Among anterior teeth, mandibular incisors—especially the mandibular lateral incisor—most often present two canals within a single root (buccal and lingual). The lingual canal is easily missed without careful troughing, illumination, and angled radiographs.

Which permanent teeth are least likely to be lost due to caries?,Maxillary canines,Maxillary first molars,Mandibular incisors,Mandibular premolars,3,"Mandibular incisors are least likely to be lost to caries because their crowns are small and smooth and benefit from tongue and saliva cleansing; they rarely have deep pits or fissures. They are more often lost for periodontal reasons or crowding, whereas maxillary first molars are early erupting and occlusally complex and thus caries‑prone.

Ideally, contacts occur only on the working side or anterior teeth. When non-functional cusps (maxillary buccal and mandibular lingual) contact on the non-working side, this is a non-working interference. Such interferences are destructive, transmitting lateral forces that can lead to cusp fracture or periodontal trauma. High-yield review: Functional cusps = maxillary lingual, mandibular buccal.

During a left working movement, the lingual cusp of maxillary first molar #14 travels along the distobuccal groove of mandibular first molar #19. This cusp-groove relationship ensures stable intercuspation and prevents interferences. High-yield review: Working side = functional cusp contacts. Maxillary lingual cusps → grooves/fossae of mandibular molars (distobuccal groove). Mandibular buccal cusps → fossae of maxillary molars.",5,,
"During a protrusive mandibular movement, the mandibular posterior cusps move against which surfaces of the maxillary teeth?",Posterior slopes of maxillary buccal cusps,Anterior slopes of maxillary lingual cusps,Incisal edges of maxillary incisors,Lingual fossae of maxillary canines,2,"In protrusion, the mandible moves forward guided by anterior teeth. Posterior teeth should disclude as mandibular posterior cusps slide against the anterior slopes of maxillary lingual cusps. This anterior guidance protects posterior teeth from destructive protrusive forces. High-yield review: Protrusion = mandibular posterior cusps contact anterior slopes of maxillary lingual cusps. Retrusion = posterior slopes of cusps. Clinical: Anterior guidance protects posterior teeth and TMJ from harmful forces.",5,,
Which permanent tooth is considered the most symmetrical in crown morphology?,Maxillary central incisor,Mandibular central incisor,Mandibular lateral incisor,Maxillary lateral incisor,2,"The mandibular central incisor is the smallest and most symmetrical tooth in the permanent dentition. Its mesial and distal surfaces appear almost identical, and the mesioincisal and distoincisal angles are equally sharp. Option 1 (maxillary central) has asymmetry between mesial and distal angles. Option 3 (mandibular lateral) is slightly larger and twisted distally at the incisal edge, making it less symmetrical. Option 4 (maxillary lateral) shows variable morphology, sometimes peg-shaped, and is the least symmetrical of anterior teeth. High-yield review: Mandibular central incisor = smallest tooth, most symmetrical, first succedaneous tooth to erupt.",5,,
A developmental groove or fissure that may extend from the lingual surface onto the root is most often seen in which tooth?,Maxillary central incisor,Maxillary lateral incisor,Mandibular canine,Maxillary canine,2,"The maxillary lateral incisor may present with a linguogingival fissure (palato-radicular groove). This developmental groove begins on the cingulum of the lingual surface and extends apically onto the root surface. It complicates scaling and root planing as it harbors plaque and calculus. Option 1 (maxillary central) does not typically exhibit this groove. Options 3 and 4 (canines) have long roots but do not characteristically display this fissure. High-yield review: Maxillary lateral incisor—variable morphology, peg laterals possible, prone to linguogingival groove which complicates periodontal therapy.",5,,
Which permanent tooth may present difficulties during root planing due to a linguogingival groove extending inciso-apically from the cingulum?,Maxillary central incisor,Maxillary lateral incisor,Mandibular central incisor,Mandibular canine,2,"The maxillary lateral incisor often exhibits a linguogingival (palato-radicular) groove that extends from the cingulum inciso-apically toward the root. This groove can be deep and difficult to instrument, making root planing challenging and increasing risk for endo-perio lesions. Options 1, 3, and 4 (central incisor, mandibular central, and mandibular canine) do not have this prominent groove and are less problematic during scaling.

"In the primary mandibular first molar, which cusp is the tallest and sharpest?",MB cusp,ML cusp,DB cusp,DL cusp,2,"The **primary mandibular first molar** is unique in its crown morphology. The **mesiolingual (ML) cusp** is the tallest and sharpest cusp, serving as a key distinguishing feature. However, the **mesiobuccal (MB) cusp** is the **largest** cusp in terms of bulk and occlusal table contribution. This asymmetry is characteristic of this tooth.

👉 **High-yield review:**

Which of the following best describes the root morphology of the mandibular lateral incisor?,"Root straight, round in cross-section",Root with mesial concavity only,Root with distal inclination and concavities (mesial > distal),Root with buccal-lingual grooves only,3,"The **mandibular lateral incisor** is slightly larger than the mandibular central incisor, but both share similar root morphology. The root typically shows a **distal inclination** and has developmental depressions (concavities) on both mesial and distal surfaces, with the **mesial concavity deeper**. This morphology helps stabilize the tooth in the arch but can complicate endodontic treatment and scaling procedures.

👉 **High-yield review:**
- Mandibular central/lateral incisors: longest roots among incisors.
- Cross-section: 'hourglass' shaped root due to concavities.
- Distal inclination common in mandibular laterals.",5,,
How does a steep condylar guidance (steep incline of condyles) affect cusp morphology?,Cusps become shorter and flatter,Cusps become taller and sharper,No effect on cusp morphology,Cusps are eliminated in favor of flat occlusion,2,"The condylar guidance is the angle formed by the path of the condyle during protrusive and lateral mandibular movements. A steep condylar guidance allows for taller, sharper cusps and deeper fossae, since there is more vertical clearance during excursions. In contrast, a shallow condylar guidance restricts cusp height, requiring cusps to be shorter and flatter to avoid occlusal interferences. Other determinants of cusp height and occlusal morphology include: Anterior guidance: Steeper anterior guidance permits taller cusps; shallow guidance requires flatter cusps. Plane of occlusion: A flatter plane allows taller cusps, whereas a steeper plane necessitates shorter cusps. Curve of Spee: A more acute curve reduces cusp height; a flatter curve allows taller cusps. Mandibular lateral translation (Bennett movement): Greater immediate lateral shift requires shorter cusps; minimal shift allows taller cusps. 👉 High-yield review: Steep condylar guidance → Taller cusps, deeper fossae. Shallow condylar guidance → Shorter cusps, shallower fossae. Determinants: condylar guidance, anterior guidance, occlusal plane, curve of Spee, Bennett movement.",5,,

This relationship provides stable intercuspation and serves as the foundation for defining normal occlusion. Class II occurs when the maxillary first molar is mesially positioned relative to the mandibular molar, while Class III occurs when it is distally positioned. 👉 High-yield review: Class I: MB cusp of maxillary 1st molar → MB groove of mandibular 1st molar. Class II: Max molars positioned mesially. Class III: Max molars positioned distally.",5,,
Which feature best describes the crown morphology of the mandibular central and lateral incisors when viewed from the incisal aspect?,"Wider mesiodistally than faciolingually, prominent marginal ridges, and a distal pit","Wider faciolingually than mesiodistally, no prominent marginal ridges, no distal pit",Equal mesiodistal and faciolingual dimensions with deep lingual fossa,Prominent cingulum with lingual pit,2,"The mandibular central and lateral incisors are the most symmetrical teeth in the arch. From the incisal aspect, their crowns are wider faciolingually than mesiodistally, reflecting their narrow mesiodistal dimension. Unlike maxillary incisors, they have no prominent marginal ridges, no lingual pit, and no significant fossa, giving them a relatively smooth lingual surface. This morphology contributes to reduced plaque accumulation compared to maxillary incisors. 👉 High-yield review: Mandibular incisors: wider FL than MD, minimal lingual anatomy. Maxillary incisors: wider MD than FL, with prominent marginal ridges and lingual fossa/pit. Mandibular central incisor: smallest and most symmetrical permanent tooth.",5,,
Which tooth is the longest in the permanent dentition?,Maxillary central incisor,Maxillary canine,Mandibular canine,Maxillary first molar,2,"The **maxillary canine** is the longest tooth overall, with an average length of ~27 mm due to its exceptionally long root and crown. Its root is the longest of any permanent tooth and provides excellent anchorage, earning it the title 'cornerstone of the arch.' Canines are critical for canine guidance during lateral excursions.

👉 Maxillary vs. Mandibular Canines (high-yield differences):
- Maxillary canine: longest tooth overall; bulkier crown; cusp tip sharper; prominent labial ridge; longer root; cingulum prominent and centered.
- Mandibular canine: crown appears longer; narrower mesiodistally; cusp tip blunter; labial ridge less pronounced; root slightly shorter; cingulum smaller and often distal.

👉 General rules:
- Maxillary canine = longest tooth overall.
- Canines are the only teeth with a labial ridge (most prominent in the maxillary).
- Canines resist caries and extraction due to long roots and strong bone support.",5,,
Which permanent tooth has the longest crown?,Maxillary canine,Mandibular canine,Maxillary central incisor,Mandibular first premolar,2,"The **mandibular canine** has the longest crown of any permanent tooth. Its crown is taller incisogingivally compared to all others, though its root is slightly shorter than that of the maxillary canine. Because of this, the maxillary canine remains the longest tooth overall, while the mandibular canine is notable for its tall crown and functional role in occlusion.

👉 Maxillary vs. Mandibular Canines (high-yield differences):
- Crown length: mandibular > maxillary.
- Root length: maxillary > mandibular.
- Cingulum: maxillary is prominent/central; mandibular is smaller and distal.
- Mesial outline: mandibular is straighter with the root axis; maxillary is more convex.

👉 General rules:
