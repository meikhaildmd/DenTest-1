In gluconeogenesis, the key biotin-dependent enzyme is pyruvate carboxylase, located in the mitochondria. It catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate (3C) ‚Üí oxaloacetate (OAA, 4C), using CO‚ÇÇ, ATP, and biotin as cofactors.

Which metabolic pathway is the major source of NADPH in cells?,TCA cycle,Pentose phosphate pathway,Glycolysis,Beta-oxidation of fatty acids,2,"The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), also called the hexose monophosphate shunt, is an alternative glucose metabolism pathway that branches from glycolysis at glucose-6-phosphate. It operates in the cytosol and has two major products:
        ‚Ä¢        NADPH, a crucial reducing agent used in:
‚Ä¢ Reductive biosynthesis (fatty acid, cholesterol, steroid synthesis).
‚Ä¢ Maintaining reduced glutathione in red blood cells, which protects against oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species. This is why G6PD deficiency leads to hemolysis.
‚Ä¢ Cytochrome P450 hydroxylation reactions, important for detoxification in the liver.
        ‚Ä¢        Ribose-5-phosphate, essential for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis.

By contrast:

        ‚Ä¢        Œ≤-oxidation of fatty acids produces NADH and FADH2, feeding into the electron transport chain for energy, but not NADPH.

üëâ High-yield summary: PPP is the only pathway that generates NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate; glycolysis/TCA/Œ≤-oxidation generate NADH/FADH2 for ATP, not NADPH.",6,,
Which structural feature distinguishes thymine from uracil?,A hydroxyl group at carbon 2,A methyl group at carbon 5,An amino group at carbon 4,A double bond at carbon 6,2,"Both uracil and thymine are pyrimidine bases. Uracil is found only in RNA, while thymine is found only in DNA. They are structurally identical except that thymine has a methyl group at the 5‚Ä≤ carbon, while uracil does not. This methylation helps stabilize DNA and allows repair enzymes to distinguish thymine from uracil that may arise via cytosine deamination. The other options are incorrect: hydroxyl at carbon 2 is a ribose feature, not a pyrimidine modification; both uracil and thymine share the same carbonyl at C4; and the double bond positions are common to both.",6,,
Which of the following best describes the role of gamma motor neurons in skeletal muscle physiology?,They innervate extrafusal fibers to generate force during contraction.,They regulate intrafusal muscle spindle sensitivity to stretch.,They mediate inhibition of antagonist muscles through reciprocal innervation.,They activate Golgi tendon organs to sense tension.,2,"Skeletal muscle fibers are divided into extrafusal fibers, which generate force, and intrafusal fibers, which are housed in muscle spindles and detect stretch. Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal fibers and adjust their baseline tension, setting the gain of the stretch reflex. This ensures spindles remain sensitive even when the muscle shortens, allowing regulation of muscle tone and length. In contrast, alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal fibers to produce force. Reciprocal innervation involves inhibitory interneurons mediated via Ia afferents, not gamma motor neurons. Golgi tendon organs sense tension and are not activated by gamma motor neurons.

üëâ High-yield review:
‚Ä¢ Gamma motor neurons ‚Üí intrafusal fibers (spindle sensitivity).

Which of the following best describes the effect of pulmonary fibrosis on lung compliance?,Increased compliance,Decreased compliance,No change in compliance,Increased compliance due to airway obstruction,2,"Lung compliance is defined as the change in lung volume per unit change in transpulmonary pressure, representing how easily the lung tissue can expand. In pulmonary fibrosis, excessive deposition of collagen and connective tissue in the interstitium makes the lungs stiff and difficult to inflate, leading to reduced compliance. At the cellular level, type I pneumocytes cover most of the alveolar surface and provide the thin barrier for gas exchange, while type II pneumocytes produce surfactant, which normally reduces surface tension and helps maintain compliance. In fibrosis, even with surfactant, the rigidity of scarred tissue prevents normal expansion. High-yield facts: Compliance increases in emphysema and decreases in fibrosis. Compliance is proportional to distensibility and inversely related to elasticity.",6,,
Which hormone stimulates pancreatic bicarbonate secretion?,Gastrin,Secretin,Cholecystokinin (CCK),Somatostatin,2,"Secretin is released by S cells of the duodenum and proximal jejunum in response to acidic chyme entering from the stomach. Its primary action is to stimulate the pancreatic ductal cells to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid, which neutralizes gastric acid and provides an optimal pH for pancreatic enzyme activity. This bicarbonate secretion protects the duodenal mucosa and ensures that enzymes like pancreatic lipase and amylase can function. Secretin also suppresses gastric acid secretion and slows gastric emptying, coordinating digestion between the stomach and intestine. High-yield facts: Secretin is known as the bicarbonate hormone, released by S cells, stimulated by acid, increases pancreatic bicarbonate, and decreases gastric acid.",6,,
In which structure do sperm undergo maturation and acquire motility after being produced in the testes?,Seminiferous tubules,Vas deferens,Epididymis,Prostate,3,"Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes under the influence of Sertoli and Leydig cells. However, newly formed sperm are non-motile and incapable of fertilization. They travel to the epididymis, where they mature, acquire motility, and are stored until ejaculation. During ejaculation, sperm pass through the vas deferens, mix with fluids from the seminal vesicles and prostate, and form semen. High-yield facts: Production occurs in seminiferous tubules, maturation and storage occur in the epididymis, and sperm are transported by the vas deferens during ejaculation.",6,,

A patient with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency would have impaired synthesis of which molecule?,Acetyl-CoA,Lactate,Oxaloacetate,Alanine,1,"The <b>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)</b> converts pyruvate into <b>acetyl-CoA</b>, feeding the TCA cycle.

"Here are two statements about nitrogen metabolism:

Statement 1: Glutamine synthetase incorporates ammonia into glutamate to form glutamine, which serves as a nontoxic transporter of ammonia in the blood.
Statement 2: Ornithine acts as an intermediate in the urea cycle, which has two mitochondrial and three cytosolic steps, occurring mainly in the liver.

Which of the following is true?",Statement 1 only,Statements 1 and 2,Statement 2 only,None,2,"Both statements are correct: Glutamine synthetase incorporates free ammonia into glutamate to form glutamine, which detoxifies ammonia and allows safe nitrogen transport in the blood. Glutamine can deliver nitrogen to tissues for biosynthetic pathways or to the liver/kidney for processing. Ornithine is a crucial intermediate in the urea cycle, the main nitrogen excretion pathway. The cycle has five steps: two mitochondrial (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, ornithine transcarbamylase) and three cytosolic (argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, arginase). Ornithine accepts carbamoyl phosphate in mitochondria to form citrulline, enabling nitrogen disposal as urea.
